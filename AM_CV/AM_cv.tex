\section{Professional summary}\label{professional-summary}

I am driven to empower our students to become leading activists. I am an
Associate Professor in the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial
Analysis, UCL and lead the MSc Urban Spatial Science, one of the largest
MSc programmes in the Bartlett. Notable activities in education
leadership, student excellence and inclusion are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spearheading major structural and pedagogical changes by combining two
  existing MScs into thematic pathways.
\item
  Securing Royal Geographical Society accreditation so graduates have a
  solid academic foundation in geographical skills and are prepared to
  address the needs of the world beyond higher education.
\item
  Attaining a £500,000 grant from the Office for Students to award
  scholarships to underrepresented groups in data science and AI.
\item
  Submitting three successful bids to the Commonwealth Share Scholarship
  scheme.
\item
  Enacting open science through publishing taught content with novel
  website books, having 53,000 global users and an
  \href{https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00141}{academic
  paper in the Journal of Open Source Education}.
\item
  Devising a new Degree Apprenticeship route to diversify income while
  enhancing classroom equity and inclusion.

Western Australia.

\section{Research}\label{research}

My research focuses on the application of spatial data, specifically
that from earth observation (e.g.~satellites) to inform and integrate
sustainability into urban decision making. All my work revolves around
an applied output that can be actioned upon by stakeholders, such as
local governments, to improve the socio-physical urban environment. My
previous work demonstrated the benefits of remotely sensing data in
consistently monitoring urban land (or expansion) to mitigate the urban
heat island effect -- a critical 21st century challenge that is often
not included within global climate models or local planning guidance. My
current work provides a spatially targeted approach to water point
rehabilitation in Tanzania in collaboration with the World Bank and the
Government of Tanzania.
