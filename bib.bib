  abstract = {Global evidence posits that we are on the cusp of fire-driven ‘tipping points’ in some of the world’s most important woody biomes including savannah woodlands, temperate forests, and boreal forests, with consequences of major changes in species dominance and vegetation type. The evidence also suggests that mega-fires are positive feedbacks to changing climates via carbon emissions, and will be responsible for large swings in water yield and quality from temperate forests at the regional scale. Two factors widely considered to have contributed to our current proximity to tipping points are changing climates and human management – the latter most obviously taking the form of allowing fuels to build up, either through policies of fire suppression or failure to implement sufficient fuel reduction fires – to the point where wildfire intensity increases dramatically. Much of the evidence comes from Australia and the USA, but domains such as Africa and the boreal north provide additional insights. Forests adapted to regimes of low-moderate intensity fires may not face the same challenges as the iconic ash forests of Australia and the coniferous forests of Yellowstone or the west coast of the USA that are adapted to high intensity fire. However the often modest physical barriers (including distance, topography and climate) between forests adapted to more frequent, low-moderate intensity fires on the one hand, and less frequent, high intensity fires on the other, are easily overcome by confluences of continually increasing fuel loads and changing climates that serve to increase both fire frequency and intensity. For temperate forests, we can mitigate the extent of large-scale, high intensity fires and their consequences if we carefully use fuel reduction fires and other standard forest management practises such as thinning. Mitigation will require assessing impacts on biodiversity of smaller, low-intensity fires at intervals of 5–10 years (to reduce fuels and mitigate fire size and intensity), against those of large-scale, high intensity wildfires at increasing (but unknown) frequency. Mitigation will require that forests be managed contiguously, not via different agencies with different objectives according to land tenure. Managing requires that governments and the communities they serve acknowledge the limitations of fire-suppression. Mitigating the incidence and effects of large-scale, high intensity fires through embracing the use of managed fire in conjunction with judicious use of fire suppression offers opportunity to avoid potentially large changes in vegetation and biomass (e.g. abundance of dominant species, biodiversity, fuel structure and loads), as well as in water yield and quality and carbon carrying capacity.},

To curb the spread of the virus, various containment measures were introduced. However, no study has explored how families protected themselves during the pandemic. Therefore, this study explored how families protected themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic using a qualitative exploratory design. Thirty-one adult participants, representing families in the Western Cape province of South Africa, were virtually interviewed. The sampling approach was both convenient and snowball. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results show that families followed and adapted to the mainstream protection measures as implemented by the South African government but in addition believed that adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions would protect them from contracting the virus. Therefore, the government and other stakeholders should support families in making it easier to protect themselves during the current and future pandemic(s).},

  abstract = {There is limited information available on the status of and threats to mangroves in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the recent years, there has been a significant increase in scientific and volunteer surveys. However, this information is usually not well integrated with information on human activities that have the potential to contribute to the degradation of these ecosystems. A project "Coastal Habitats at Risk" is being developed jointly by the United Nations University (UNU) and the World Resources Institute, and in partnership with UNESCO and the International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems (ISME), in an effort to ameliorate this situation through standardized assessment of anthropogenic threats to mangroves in East and Southeast Asia. The geographic focus of the project includes Brunei, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Threats from pollution, over-harvesting, aquaculture development, boating/shipping, flooding/freshwater input, siltation and other coastal development are examined with this map-based analysis. The study particularly emphasizes information regarding the human element of these ecosystems, with an eye towards community-based management and action. A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool will be developed to examine different coastal development and management scenarios and their implications for mangrove health, diversity and value. The results will serve as an indication of the threats to these ecosystems, not as an actual measure of degradation. This information generation can be seen as a first step toward assessing global needs for the world's mangrove ecosystems that to date remain largely unassessed. The analysis is intended to recommend policies, participatory approaches and management strategies to promote integrated coastal ecosystem approaches. It will help fill an information void through much-needed policy guidance on management and priority setting.},

In response to these challenges, the researcher proposes a comprehensive ‘Sustainability Framework for Water Infrastructure’. This framework is designed to guide every stage of water infrastructure development, starting from pre-construction with an emphasis on inclusive project planning, followed by the construction phase where suitable techniques are utilized, and extending to the post-construction stage, focusing on efficient monitoring and management mechanisms.

We analyzed respiratory and cardiovascular mortality as well as all-cause mortality in relation to dust storm events over a 5-year study period, using data obtained through a population-based retrospective ecological time series study. Dust storm days were identified when the national daily average of PM10 exceeded 200 μg/m3. Generalized additive models with Poisson link were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of age-stratified daily mortality associated with dust events, after adjusting for potential confounders including weather variables and long-term trends. There was no significant association between dust storm events and same-day respiratory mortality (RR = 0.96; 95 \%CI 0.88–1.04), cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.98; 95 \%CI 0.96–1.012) or all-cause mortality (RR = 0.99; 95 \%CI 0.97–1.00). Overall our findings suggest that local dust, that most likely originates from crustal materials, has little impact on short-term respiratory, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Introduction Outbreaks of Saharan dust have been shown to exacerbate the effect of particulate matter (PM) on mortality. Their role on PM–morbidity association is less clear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of Saharan dust on the PM–hospitalisations association in Rome, Italy. Methods We studied residents hospitalised in Rome between 2001 and 2004 and performed a time-series analysis to explore the effects of PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 on cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory emergency hospitalisations, respectively. Saharan dust days were identified by combining Light Detection and Ranging observations and analyses from operational models. We tested a dust–PM interaction to evaluate the hypothesis that the PM effect on hospitalisations would be enhanced on dust days. Results We studied 77 354, 26 557 and 31 620 hospitalisations for cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively, providing effect estimates per IQR. PM2.5–10 was associated with cardiac diseases (3.93\%; 95\% CI 1.58 to 6.34). PM10 was associated with cardiac (3.37\%; 95\% CI 1.11 to 5.68), cerebrovascular (2.64\%; 95\% CI 0.06 to 5.29) and respiratory diseases (3.59\%: 95\% CI 0.18 to 7.12). No effect of PM2.5 was detected. Saharan dust modified the effect of the PM2.5–10 on respiratory hospitalisations, higher during dust days compared with dust-free days (14.63\% vs −0.32\%; p value of interaction=0.006). Saharan dust also increased the effect of PM10 on cerebrovascular diseases (5.04\% vs 0.90\%, p value of interaction=0.143). Discussion A clear enhanced effect of PM2.5–10 on respiratory diseases and of PM10 on cerebrovascular diseases emerged during Saharan dust outbreaks.},

Visible and near infrared bands (i.e. bands 3 and 4) of the near-anniversary (August) images from 1984 and 2006 were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. NDVI images for the earlier and later dates were analyzed. ASTER and Quickbird images, topographic maps, forest stand maps were used as ancillary data. Spatial distribution of change is mapped and interpreted. Results showed that forest regeneration took place especially in upper lands, while deforestation occurred at lower altitudes in relatively smaller patches in close proximity to the coast and to the roads.},

In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

  abstract = {Field spectroradiometers are widely used for environmental applications where data describing visible and near-infrared reflectance factors are of interest. Recent developments in spaceborne and airborne instruments with multiple view angle (MVA) capabilities have resulted in a demand for ground measurements to support these missions. Lightweight portable spectroradiometers offer an appropriate means of collecting MVA spectral reflectance factor data because they are more easily manoeuvrable than other spectroradiometers, but their physical capabilities have not yet been explored in this context. This letter presents the results of a focused experiment aimed at evaluating the field capabilities of a miniaturized Ocean Optics instrument in MVA settings for soil surface roughness applications. MVA hemispherical-conical reflectance factors were collected in situ from soil surfaces whose roughness was determined using a laser profiling survey. The results showed a significant negative relationship (R 2 = 0.74; p {$<$} 0.01) between directional reflectance factors measured at 870 nm in the forward-scattering region and a soil structural measure derived from laser profiling data. This corroborates the results of other published studies and suggests that Ocean Optics instruments can be used to support hyperspectral MVA investigations.},

  abstract = {The direct retrieval of canopy height and the estimation of aboveground biomass are two important measures of forest structure that can be quantified by airborne laser scanning at landscape scales. These and other metrics are central to studies attempting to quantify global carbon cycles and to improve understanding of the spatial variation in forest structure evident within differing biomes. Data acquired using NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) over the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) was used to assess the performance of waveform lidar in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. Using coincident plots established for this study, we found strong agreement between field and lidar measurements of height (r2 = 0.80, p \&lt; 0.000) at the footprint level. Allometric calculations of aboveground biomass (AGBM) and LVIS metrics (AGBM: r2 = 0.61, PRESS RMSE = 58.0~Mg ha− 1, p \&lt; 0.000) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) and LVIS metrics (r2 = 0.54, p = 0.002) also showed good agreement at the footprint level. Application of a generalized equation for determining AGBM proposed by Lefsky et al. (2002a) to footprint-level field data from Bartlett resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.55; RMSE = 64.4~Mg ha− 1; p = 0.002. This is slightly weaker than the strongest relationship found with the best-fit single term regression model. Relationships between a permanent grid of USDA Forest Service inventory plots and the mean values of aggregated LVIS metrics, however, were not as strong. This discrepancy suggests that validation efforts must be cautious in using pre-existing field data networks as a sole means of calibrating and verifying such remote sensing data. Stratification based on land-use or species composition, however, did provide the means to improve regression relationships at this scale. Regression models established at the footprint level for AGBM and QMSD were applied to LVIS data to generate predicted values for the whole of Bartlett. The accuracy of these models was assessed using varying subsets of the USFS NERS plot data. Coefficient of determinations ranged from fair to strong with aspects of land-use history and species composition influencing both the fit and the level of error seen in the predicted relationships.},

  abstract = {This paper utilizes information from the 2015 Nigeria National Water and Sanitation Survey to identify the extent, timing, as well as reasons for the failure of water points. The paper finds that more than 38 percent of all improved water points are nonfunctional. The results indicate that nearly 27 percent of the water points are likely to fail in the first year of construction, while nearly 40 percent are likely to fail in the long run (after 8-10 years). The paper considers the reasons behind these failures, looking at whether they can or cannot be controlled. During the first year, a water point's location -- the political region and underlying hydrogeology -- has the greatest impact on functionality. Other factors—specifically, those that can be controlled in the design, implementation, and operational stages -- also contribute significantly. As water points age, their likelihood of failure is best predicted by factors that cannot be modified, as well as by the technology used. The paper concludes that, to improve the sustainability of water points, much can be done at the design, implementation, and operational stages. Over time, technology upgrades are important.},

Its potential, however, has not been fully explored in complex forested ecosystems, especially in riparian forests, considered among the most dynamic and complex portions of the Earth's biosphere. In this study, forest inventory data and multiple ground scans were obtained in a sparse managed and dense natural riparian forest on the immediate banks of the mid-lower portion of the Garonne River in Southern France, dominated by black poplar (Populus nigra) and commercial hybrid poplars (Populus × euramericana). Overall, the ground-based laser-scanning analysis successfully estimated trunk diameters, tree heights and crown radii from both managed and natural riparian forests. However, the ground scanner analysis was not as successful in identifying all of the trunks in the dense natural riparian forest, with only 141 trunks identified from a total of 234. This also results in allometric scaling exponents for ground scanning, which are significantly different from field-derived exponents. This study thus shows that there may be a limit to the number of trees detected in higher density forests, even with multiple scans.},

Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of strong distancing measures, such as lockdowns, against their economic costs, especially the burdens imposed on low income and food insecure households. The distancing measures deployed by South Africa impose large economic costs and have negative implications for the factor distribution of income. Labor with low education levels are much more strongly affected than labor with secondary or tertiary education. As a result, households with low levels of educational attainment and high dependence on labor income would experience an enormous real income shock that would clearly jeopardize the food security of these households. However, in South Africa, total incomes for low income households are significantly insulated by government transfer payments. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of Covid-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of ‘black swan’ type shocks.},

  abstract = {Increasing population and life standards causes fossil fuel consumption to increase. Due to this increasing consumption, fossil fuels are being depleted rapidly. In addition to rapid exhaustion, another important problem associated with fossil fuels is that their consumption has major negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, many countries around the world have included renewable energy systems (RES) in their future energy plans so that they can produce reliable and environmentally friendly energy. Parallel to this trend, various RES have been identified and recently integrated into the current energy network of Turkey as well. However, it should be recognized that renewable energy resources are not fully environmentally safe. Different RES are associated with different environmental impacts. In planning the future energy development of a country, evaluation of renewable energy resources potentials together with their associated environmental impacts is critical. The aim of this study is to create a decision support system for site selection of wind turbines using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Wind energy potential and environmental fitness/acceptability are used as decision criteria for the site selection process. Potential environmental impacts of wind generation are identified in accordance with Turkish legislations and previous studies; and represented as fuzzy objectives of the decision problem. Wind potential map of Turkey generated by General Directorate of Electrical Power Resources Survey and Development is used to identify economically feasible locations in terms of wind energy generation. A study area composed of Usak, Aydin, Denizli, Mugla, and Burdur provinces in Turkey is selected and divided into 250 m × 250 m grids. Each grid represents an alternative location for a wind turbine or group of wind turbines. Fuzzy environmental objectives such as “Acceptable in terms of noise level”, “Acceptable in terms of bird habitat”, “Acceptable in terms of safety and aesthetics” and “Safe in terms of natural reserves” associated with wind turbines are identified based on previous research and each of these objectives are represented by a fuzzy set. Individual satisfaction degree of each of these environmental objectives for each grid is calculated. Then these individual satisfactions are aggregated into an overall satisfaction degree using various aggregator operators such as “and”, “or”, and “order weighted averaging.” Thus, an overall satisfaction degree of all the environmental objectives is obtained for each grid in the study area. A map of environmental fitness is developed in GIS environment by using these overall satisfaction degrees. Then this map is utilized together with the wind potential map of Turkey to identify both potentially and environmentally feasible wind turbine locations within the study area.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors associated with cholera outbreaks is an integral part of designing better approaches to mitigate their impact. Using a rich set of georeferenced case data from the cholera epidemic that occurred in Harare from September 2018 to January 2019, we apply spatio-temporal modelling to better understand how the outbreak unfolded and the factors associated with higher risk of being a reported case. Using Call Detail Records (CDR) to estimate weekly population movement of the community throughout the city, results suggest that broader human movement (not limited to infected agents) helps to explain some of the spatio-temporal patterns of cases observed. In addition, results highlight a number of socio-demographic risk factors and suggest that there is a relationship between cholera risk and water infrastructure. The analysis shows that populations living close to the sewer network, with high access to piped water are associated with at higher risk. One possible explanation for this observation is that sewer bursts led to the contamination of the piped water network. This could have turned access to piped water, usually assumed to be associated with reduced cholera risk, into a risk factor itself. Such events highlight the importance of maintenance in the provision of SDG improved water and sanitation infrastructure.},

  abstract = {An increase in public awareness regarding the negative impact of traditional power-generating methods, especially coal and oil-fired power stations, on the environment has created a demand for developing and using environmentally friendly renewable energy. Wind power is a popular and safe form of renewable energy. It can be economically viable, does not produce any physical pollution and can contribute radically to the reduction in air pollution. In the UK, the demand for wind energy is mounting. However, achieving the goal set by the EU will require a substantial expansion. Planning and environmental restrictions and conflicts would inevitably accompany this growth. A questionnaire targeting relevant public and private sectors in the UK has revealed the lack of coherent national criteria for locating wind farms. Using information from the questionnaire and the available published literature, simple Geographical Information System (GIS)-assisted wind farm location criteria were developed for the UK. A GIS (IDRISI) was employed to apply these criteria using two different methods to combine information layers for a site in Lancashire. The first considered all the layers as being equally important and gave them equal weight. The second grouped the layers and graded them according to perceived importance. The outputs were composed of classes from 0 to 10, where 0 represents ideal locations and 10 represents unsuitable locations. Using the second method has resulted in a slight increase in the geographical extent for the most suitable sites. These maps can be used to assist in the decision-making process when locating wind farm sites.},

Only recently, however, have relevant spatial data become available and have demographic survey data systematically recorded geographical location of surveyed households, or has the technology to integrate these data become accessible. This study estimates the risk of infant and child death in ten West African countries attributable to individual, household and spatially explicit geographical factors; 120,000 births occurring in the 10 years prior to the 1997–2001 Demographic and Health Survey dates are evaluated. Results from a generalised linear model show that spatial variables explain away a good deal of the country-specific variation in mortality, and that they are associated with (and may be mediated by) the household characteristics.

In this commentary, we reflect on issues common to ECR experiences in quantitative human geography. Our discussion is inspired by and develops conversations from a panel at the Royal Geographical Society-Institute of British Geographers (RGS-IBG) postgraduate forum, with panellists from across the subfield. While many aspects of the ECR experience transcend sub-disciplinary boundaries, the quantitative subfield presents unique dynamics for ECRs to navigate. ECRs in quantitative geography are steeped in ‘data science’, which changes relations between academia and industry, with the growth of our field increasing the size and the scope of what ECRs might be expected to know and do. Bringing together reflections from the panel, we highlight the variation in pathways experienced by ECRs, reflecting on opportunities, uncertainties, and mentorship, in the hope of offering insights and advice for prospective and current ECRs and their mentors. This commentary reflects on the perspectives and experiences of early career quantitative human geographers, placing significant emphasis on opportunities, uncertainty, and mentorship, and the overall diversity of pathways available to other early career quantitative human geographers.},

  abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) technology is capable of precisely measuring a variety of vegetation metrics, the estimates of which are usually based on relative heights above a digital elevation model (DEM). As a result, the development of these elevation models is a critical step when processing lidar observations. A number of different algorithms exist to interpolate lidar ground hits into a terrain surface. We tested seven interpolation routines, using small footprint lidar data, collected over a range of vegetation classes on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The lidar data were randomly subsetted into a prediction dataset and a validation dataset. A suite of DEMs were then generated using linear, quintic, natural neighbour, regularized spline, spline with tension, a finite difference approach (ANUDEM), and inverse distance weighted interpolation routines, at spatial resolutions of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m. In order to examine the effects of terrain and ground cover on interpolation accuracies, the study area was stratified by terrain slope, vegetation structural class, lidar ground return density, and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from Quickbird and Landsat7 ETM+ imagery. The root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute errors of the residuals between the surfaces and the validation points indicated that the 0.5 m DEMs were the most accurate. Of the tested approaches, the regularized spline and IDW algorithms produced the most extreme outliers, sometimes in excess of ±6 m in sloping terrain. Overall, the natural neighbour algorithm provided the best results with a minimum of effort. Finally, a method to create prediction uncertainty maps using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis is proposed.},

Using the DPSIR indicator-based approach, agricultural land use changes and conversions occurred within the periods 1976–1994 and 1994–2003, have been associated with the shortage of water in the river and the modification of the landscape structure. Results show that Lamone river basin in 1976 was mainly dominated by forest (27.4\%) and cropland (32.3\%) and through the entire period the valley presented a strong persistence of land uses and the main conversions detected are afforestation and agricultural intensification. The hydrological balance analysis results indicate that the agricultural intensification process produced a water deficit in summer periods equal to 0.89 mln m3 in 2003. The landscape of the Lamone valley became more homogeneous, showing a decrease in diversity (Shannon Diversity Index values decreased from 1.81 to 1.58) and the riparian corridor became more human-dominated (Human Habitat values increased from 0.61 to 0.77). An integrated assessment of possible management options has been conducted, using the MULINO-DSS software as a support. Thirteen different management scenarios have been produced in order to solve the water balance issue and to enhance the riparian corridor. Attributing equal weight to the environmental, social and economical criteria, the best solution corresponds to the sole creation of artificial basins and the actual situation is placed at position 8 (out of 13).},

The project aims at deriving area estimates of tropical forest cover change for the periods 1990–2000–2005. The paper presents the pre-processing steps applied in an operational and robust manner to this large amount of multi-date and multi-scene imagery: conversion to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, cloud and cloud shadow detection, haze correction and image radiometric normalization. The results show that the haze correction algorithm has improved the visual appearance of the image and significantly corrected the digital numbers for Landsat visible bands, especially the red band. The impact of the normalization procedures (forest normalization and relative normalization) was assessed on 210 image pairs: in all cases the correlation between the spectral values of the same land cover in both images was improved. The developed automatic pre-processing chain provided a consistent multi-temporal data set across the tropics that will constitute the basis for an automatic object-based supervised classification.},

  abstract = {Appraisal of ecological impacts has been problematic because of the behavior of ecological system and the responses of these systems to human intervention are far from fully understood. While it has been relatively easy to itemize the potential ecological impacts, it has been difficult to arrive at accurate predictions of how these impacts affect populations, communities, or ecosystems. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of ecological systems has been overlooked because its examination is practically impossible through matrix techniques, the most commonly used impact assessment approach. Besides, the public has become increasingly aware of the importance of the EIA in decision-making and thus the interpretation of impact significance is complicated further by the different value judgments of stakeholders. Moreover, impact assessments are carried out with a minimum of data, high uncertainty, and poor conceptual understanding. Hence, the evaluation of ecological impacts entails the integration of subjective and often conflicting judgments from a variety of experts and stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to present an environmental impact assessment approach based on the integration fuzzy logic, geographical information systems and optimization techniques. This approach enables environmental analysts to deal with the intrinsic imprecision and ambiguity associated with the judgments of experts and stakeholders, the description of ecological systems, and the prediction of ecological impacts. The application of this approach is illustrated through an example, which shows how consensus about impact mitigation can be attained within a conflict resolution framework.},

  abstract = {This study presents a thorough approach, based on the application of multi-spectral remote sensing Landsat imagery, to determine human-induced forest cover change in Italy during the decade 2002–2011. A total of 785.6 ×1 04 ha of forestland was mapped using the main forest classes described within the CORINE land cover 2006 database (3.11 – broad-leaved forest; 3.12 – coniferous forest; 3.13 – mixed forest). The approach employs multi-temporal Landsat imagery to determine large-scale spatiotemporal variations in forest cover with a high degree of precision. The semi-automated procedure is based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) pixel-oriented image differencing technique. The results were validated and rectified as a result of on-screen visual interpretation, whereby all the false-positive forest changes that were incorrectly mapped during the automatic procedure were identified and removed. The derived high-resolution data of forest cover change show that 317,535 ha (4.04\% of the total forest area in Italy) were harvested during the period under review. The 125,272 individual clear-cut areas identified are mainly located within protected areas of the European Natura 2000 network. The outcome of this study is a publicly accessible database that can encourage further studies in the framework of international biodiversity and soil protection conventions (http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/themes/erosion/italy/). The methodology can contribute to the monitoring of human-induced forest changes in support of the Kyoto Protocol.},

The test area covers about 837,330.5 ha of a mountainous region in Central Italy. The approach employs several multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions to account for forest cover changes larger than 0.5 ha for the period from March 2002 to July 2011. In contrast to automated approaches that strongly curtail mapping time, the approach introduced here allowed us to map only the real forest cover change, based on a robust validation and rectification of the detected forest change. Derived high spatial resolution data of forest change estimates indicate that about 5.7\% (47,670.5 ha) of the observed forest area was subject to human-induced change between 2002 and 2011. Moreover, the detected forest cover changes, most of which are identifiable as timber harvesting, are considerably larger than those reported in the official statistics and often fall within the perimeter of restricted areas (i.e., national parks and natural reserves).},

  abstract = {The term "Geographic Information Systems" (GIS) has been added to MeSH in 2003, a step reflecting the importance and growing use of GIS in health and healthcare research and practices. GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e.g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. The concepts and principles presented in this paper can be also applied in other countries, and on regional (e.g., European Union) and global levels. PMID: 14748927},

  abstract = {Forest cover change is one of the most important land cover change processes globally, and old-growth forests continue to disappear despite many efforts to protect them. At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62\% in 1990 to 64\% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26\% in 1990, to 20\% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14\%) or non-pine scrub forest (66\%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a “best-case scenario” for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.},

  abstract = {The estimation of fluvial sediment transport rate from measurements of morphological change has received growing recent interest. The revival of the ‘morphological method’ reflects continuing concern over traditional methods of rate determination but also the availability of new survey methods capable of high-precision, high-resolution topographic monitoring. Remote sensing of river channels through aerial digital photogrammetry is a potentially attractive alternative to labour intensive ground surveys. However, while photogrammetry presents the opportunity to acquire survey data over large areas, data precision and accuracy, particularly in the vertical dimension are lower than in traditional ground survey methods. This paper presents results of recent research in which digital elevation models (DEMs) have been developed for a reach of a large braided gravel-bed river in Scotland using both digital photogrammetry and high-resolution RTK GPS ground surveys. A statistical level of change detection is assessed by comparing surfaces with independent check points. The methodological sensitivity of the annual channel sediment budget (1999–2000) to the threshold is presented. Results suggest that while the remote survey methods employed here can be used to develop qualitatively convincing, moderate precision DEMs of channel topography (RMSE=±0.21 m), the remaining errors imply significant limits on reliable change detection which lead to important information losses. Tests at a 95\% confidence interval for change detection show that over 60\% of channel deposition and 40\% of erosion may be obscured by the lower level of precision associated with photogrammetric monitoring when compared to ground survey measurements. This bias reflects the difficulty of detecting the topographic signature of widespread, but shallow deposition on bar tops.},

One of the goals in processing this data is to set up filtering methods which automatically allows to extract the ground and the features (buildings, vegetation, etc.) superimposed on the terrain itself. In our work the emphasis is focused on the first topic. The implemented method takes advantage of the use of spline functions regularised by means of Tychonov functional in a least-squares approach. Firstly, the DSM pixels have been classified in order to previously detect any edges of the non-terrain feature. Then all the pixels corresponding to the ground, by means of a region growing algorithm, has been identified through a correction procedure. Finally, by a new interpolation on the classified ground pixel only, we can derive the digital terrain model. In the paper the processing methodology is discussed; and a first extensive example is presented.},

  abstract = {LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is one of the most recent technologies in surveying and mapping. LIDAR is based on the combination of three different data collection tools: a laser scanner mounted on an aircraft, a Global Positioning System (GPS) used in phase differential kinematic modality to provide the sensor position and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) to provide the orientation. The laser sends towards the ground an infrared signal, which is reflected back to the sensor. The time employed by the signal, given the aircraft position and attitude, allows computation of the earth point elevation. In standard conditions, taking into account the flight (speed 200–250 km/hour, altitude 500–2,000 m) and sensor characteristics (scan angle ± 10–20 degrees, emission rate 2,000–50,000 pulses per second), earth elevations are collected within a density of one point every 0.5–3 m. The technology allows us therefore to obtain very accurate (5–20 cm) and high resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM). For many applications, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is needed: we have to automatically detect and discard from the previous DSM all the features (buildings, trees, etc.) present on the terrain. This paper describes a procedure that has been implemented within GRASS to construct DTMs from LIDAR source data.},

Some body movement exercises reveal student teachers' spatial orientations. The paper proposes that the very evolution of geometry, and the ontological status of its objects, relate to their representation in cultural forms referenced to human self-image. It is further argued that learning crucially relates to evolving mathematical or pedagogical understandings of spatial phenomena.},

Instead of simulation approach, which is typical when facing many health care applications, our approach is distinctively based on a mathematical programming formulation of the relevant problem. In particular, we focus on the critical role of time in transplantation process as well as on a spatial distribution of transplant centers. The allocation of transplantable organs across regions with the objective of attaining regional equity in health care, is the aim of this paper. Our model differs from previous modeling approaches in that it considers the nationwide reorganization of the transplant system, identifying system barriers that may impair equity and efficiency. The demolition of these barriers may leads on a reduction of waiting lists and of wasted organs. We provide the basic structure and the properties of the model, and validate it on a real case study. The experimental validation of the model demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposal.},

This paper outlines the economic, social and environmental benefits of urban vegetation and trees and investigates the consequences of urban consolidation on established vegetation and trees in Como, an inner suburb, south of Perth, Western Australia (WA). It presents data from a longitudinal study utilizing photographic evidence and visual observations over several years. This study reveals an overwhelming trend for the removal of all landscaping when land is redeveloped under the current policy direction of urban consolidation. This paper investigates the importance of urban vegetation and trees, as a significant and valuable proportion of ‘greenery’ in urban areas. A conclusion drawn is that there exists little or no incentive for developers to preserve established urban vegetation and trees and only limited capacity to regulate for the protection of established ‘greenery’ in the private domain. Finally, the authors provide some recommendations, which emerge from this research.},

  abstract = {Optimization modeling has become a powerful tool to tackle emergency logistics problems since its first adoption in maritime disaster situations in the 1970s. Using techniques of content analysis, this paper reviews optimization models utilized in emergency logistics. Disaster operations can be performed before or after disaster occurrence. Short-notice evacuation, facility location, and stock pre-positioning are drafted as the main pre-disaster operations, while relief distribution and casualty transportation are categorized as post-disaster operations. According to these operations, works in the literature are broken down into three parts: facility location, relief distribution and casualty transportation, and other operations. For the first two parts, the literature is structured and analyzed based on the model types, decisions, objectives, and constraints. Finally, through the content analysis framework, several research gaps are identified and future research directions are proposed.},

Methods Based on intensive literature review, we compared the distribution and areas of existing mangroves among selected provinces of China, discussed the issues associated with mangrove conservation and restoration and highlighted major progresses on mangrove research conducted by key institutions or universities in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. Important findings The population boom and rapid economic developments have greatly reduced mangrove areas in China since 1980s, leaving only 22 700 ha mangroves in mainland China in 2001. Chinese government has launched a series of programs to protect mangroves since 1980s and has established mangrove ecosystems as high-priority areas for improving environmental and living resource management. During last three decades, a total of 34 natural mangrove conservation areas have been established, which accounts for 80\% of the total existing mangroves areas in China. Mangrove restoration areas in Mainland China accounted for {$<$}7\% of the total mangroves areas in 2002. A great deal of research papers on Chinese mangroves has been published in international journals. However, more systematic protection strategies and active restoration measurements are still urgently needed in order to preserve these valuable resources in China.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Previous findings of the association between socioeconomic deprivation (SED) and survival after stroke are inconsistent. There is less investigation on long-term survival. We assessed the associations in a multi-ethnic population in England. Methods—We examined data from 4398 patients (3103 whites, 932 blacks, and 253 Asians/others) with first-ever stroke, collected by a population-based stroke register in South London from 1995 to 2011. SED was measured using the Carstairs index score—the higher score, the more deprived. It was analyzed in multivariate Cox regression models in relation to survival after stroke. Results—During 17-year follow-up 2754 patients died. The quartile data of Carstairs score showed no significant association of SED with survival in patients, except for black Caribbeans and Africans. Black patients with the fourth quartile SED had a multivariate adjusted hazard ratio of 1.76 (95\% confidence interval, 1.06–2.94) for 3-month mortality and 1.54 (1.00–2.37) for 1-year mortality. After adjustment for acute stroke care provisions, these were no longer significant. However, the sextile data of Carstairs score showed a consistent association of SED with survival after stroke; all patients with the sixth sextile had a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.23 (1.05–1.44) for 3-month mortality and 1.13 (1.01–1.25) for 17-year mortality. Conclusions—There is a weak but significant association of SED with reduced survival after stroke in England. SED in blacks may have a stronger impact on short-term survival when compared with white patients. Further efforts are required to achieve equality in survival among patients with stroke of different socioeconomic groups.},

  abstract = {The paper contributes towards deciphering and decoding the misery of the urban poor in light of the COVID-19 scourge. The paper unpacks urban poverty in light of the corona virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 and the lack of any vaccines requires physical distancing as preventative measures to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Governments across the world, including in Anglophone Sub Saharan Africa have implemented lockdown measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is happening within settlements where the majority of the population lives from hand to mouth. In Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanisation and increased urban poverty, COVID-19 scourge has had a huge impact on the urban poor. The COVID-19 is likely to devastate economies and the community. For rapidly growing, densely populated and poorly planned settlements, the situation is tragic for these inhabitants. Nation states lockdown and social and physical distancing in response to the pandemic have escalated their misery. The paper adopts a critical review of literature anchored in case study analysis, document analysis and scanning from reports. Results point to redefining the way humanity has related, functioned and conceptualised realities. There is need to go beyond prevention from infection as majority of urban dwellers are in the informal sector or unemployed. For the urban poor, strategies for social distancing may not be possible or effective. People are being asked to make choices between being hungry and risk of getting infected. The paper recommends planning response at national, regional and local level bearing in mind informal settlements, high densities and forms of overcrowding which have been placed as hotspots for the virus. There is need for rebuilding societies, during and beyond COVID-19 calling for immediate disaster risk planning adaptation and transformation to promote resilience.},

Concerns about limited water allocations, conservation of environmental and water qualities and policies for sustainable water use have been increased because rising water demand would cause water shortage in the near future. Therefore, it is necessary to look into possible alternative water resources management plans to mitigate the potential water shortage. However, it is not straightforward to predict and analyze the various situations likely to be occurred in the future. Also, finding an optimal solution among many alternatives to mitigate the water shortage is a complex task. In this study, a methodology of predicting and analyzing the water resources situations in the future using the K-WEAP (Korea Water Evaluation and Planning system) is presented and an optimal alternative is determined using the MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) that takes into account the economic, environmental, and social sectors. The proposed methodology is applied to the Nakdong River basin in South Korea to calculate water budget and possible water shortage. An optimal water shortage mitigation policy for the study basin is also suggested to help decision maker develop long-term water resources management strategies.},

  abstract = {In this paper we provide an overview of various satellite products over the Sahara Desert that were available during the GERBILS field campaign. Our results indicate that all mid-visible satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products match well with AERONET retrievals. For low AOD (AOD {$<$} 1), the satellite AODs compare well with aircraft AOD values but they tend to underestimate at high AOD values. We then assessed the satellite products in 0.5 × 0.5 degree grids for the entire study region (10–30°N and 20°W–10°E). If we use a multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) as a benchmark for AOD retrievals over bright targets, the estimated AOD derived from the ozone-monitoring instrument aerosol index–MISR relationship performs best when compared with MISR for the entire study region. Although differences exist among satellite products, the advancement in satellite retrieval techniques now provide AOD retrievals over bright targets such as deserts, which are useful for numerical modeling simulation comparisons and other studies. Furthermore, the in situ information from aircraft and the ground continue to provide valuable information for validating satellite products and for assessing their strengths and weaknesses.

  abstract = {Background Access to cardiac services is essential for appropriate implementation of evidence-based therapies to improve outcomes. The Cardiac Accessibility and Remoteness Index for Australia (Cardiac ARIA) aimed to derive an objective, geographic measure reflecting access to cardiac services. Methods and Results An expert panel defined an evidence-based clinical pathway. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the team developed a numeric/alphabetic index at 2 points along the continuum of care. The acute category (numeric) measured the time from the emergency call to arrival at an appropriate medical facility via road ambulance. The aftercare category (alphabetic) measured access to 4 basic services (family doctor, pharmacy, cardiac rehabilitation, and pathology services) when a patient returned to his or her community. The numeric index ranged from 1 (access to principal referral center with cardiac catheterization service ≤1 hour) to 8 (no ambulance service, {$>$}3 hours to medical facility, air transport required). The alphabetic index ranged from A (all 4 services available within a 1-hour drive-time) to E (no services available within 1 hour). The panel found that 13.9 million Australians (71\%) resided within Cardiac ARIA 1A locations (hospital with cardiac catheterization laboratory and all aftercare within 1 hour). Those outside Cardiac 1A were overrepresented by people {$>$}65 years of age (32\%) and indigenous people (60\%). Conclusions The Cardiac ARIA index demonstrated substantial inequity in access to cardiac services in Australia. This methodology can be used to inform cardiology health service planning and could be applied to other common disease states within other regions of the world.},

  abstract = {Disaster planning for slow-onset city-wide shocks will be become increasingly necessary, particularly as cities face increasingly severe climate hazards. This paper provides unique insight into the disaster planning and management that was undertaken by the City of Cape Town government in response to its most severe hydrological drought on record. It describes how risk was understood and why decisions were made on key elements of the plan, including trigger points, risk prioritisation and mitigation, and the location and design of points of distribution of water rations for the public. Reflecting upon the authors’ experience and interviews with senior City officials who worked on the drought disaster planning and response, the paper extracts five key lessons learnt that have since been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) the need for cross-functional planning and response skills, (ii) the need for integrated, up-to-date and scale-appropriate data; (iii) the importance of scenario-based simulations, communication and rapid costing to enable the rapid scaling-up of a response; (iv) the value of being able to use outsourced expert capacity effectively; and (v) the application of previously used disaster management and planning experience to build resilience in cities. These lessons, captured in a visual framework, help reflect on capabilities required for responding to future city-scale disasters. The paper provides an informative case study for other cities and risk managers, and will be particularly useful for global South contexts that face drought and other slow-onset disasters, most recently illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Forest fires are a serious management challenge in many regions, complicating the appropriate allocation to suppression and prevention efforts. Using a System Dynamics (SD) model, this paper explores how interactions between physical and political systems in forest fire management impact the effectiveness of~different allocations. A core issue is that apparently sound management can have unintended consequences. An instinctive management response to periods of worsening fire severity is to increase fire suppression capacity, an approach with immediate appeal as it directly treats the symptom of devastating fires and appeases the public. However, the SD analysis indicates that a policy emphasizing suppression can degrade the long-run effectiveness of forest fire management. By crowding out efforts to preventative fuel removal, it exacerbates fuel loads and leads to greater fires, which further balloon suppression budgets. The business management literature refers to this problem as the firefighting trap, wherein focus on fixing problems diverts attention from preventing them, and thus leads to inferior outcomes. The paper illustrates these phenomena through a case study of Portugal, showing that a~balanced approach to suppression and prevention efforts can mitigate the self-reinforcing consequences of this trap, and better manage long-term fire damages. These insights can help policymakers and fire managers better appreciate the interconnected systems in which their authorities reside and the dynamics that may undermine seemingly rational management decisions.},

  abstract = {Considerable effort has been devoted over the years to fighting uncertainty in geographic information in its different manifestations. Thus far, research on handling inaccuracy, fuzziness, error and related issues has focused for the most part on problems with spatial data and their direct products, typically representations of spatial objects or fields. This paper seeks to broaden the discussion of uncertainty in the geospatial domain by shifting the focus from information to knowledge. It turns out that there is a surprising number of things that we cannot know (or questions we cannot answer) that are not the result of imperfect information. Forms of not knowing are pervasive in domains as diverse as mathematics, logic, physics, and linguistics, and are apparently irreducible. This being the case it may help to explore how these realms of ignorance may affect our efforts. The paper distinguishes three different modes or forms of geospatial knowledge production, and argues that each of them has built–in imperfections, for reasons of logical principle and not just empirical fact. While much can and needs to be done to manage and resolve uncertainties where possible, I argue for accepting that uncertainty is an intrinsic property of complex knowledge and not just a flaw that needs to be excised.},

  abstract = {A novel approach to image radiometric normalization for change detection is presented. The approach referred to as stratified relative radiometric normalization (SRRN) uses a time-series of imagery to stratify the landscape for localized radiometric normalization. The goal is to improve the detection accuracy of abrupt land cover changes (human-induced, natural disaster, etc.) while decreasing false detection of natural vegetation changes that are not of interest. These vegetation changes may be associated with such phenomena as phenology, growth and stress (e.g. drought), which occur at varying spatial and temporal scales, depending on landscape position, vegetation type, season, precipitation history and historic episodes of local disturbance. The SRRN approach was tested for a study area on the Californian border between the USA and Mexico using Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite imagery. Change products were generated from imagery radiometrically normalized using the SRRN procedure and with imagery normalized using a traditional empirical line technique. Reference data derived from high spatial resolution airborne imagery were utilized to validate the two change products. The SRRN procedure provided several benefits and was found to improve the overall accuracy of detecting abrupt land cover changes by nearly 20\%.},

  abstract = {The sustainable use and management of important tropical coastal ecosystems (mangrove forests, seagrass beds and coral reefs) cannot be done without understanding the direct and indirect impacts of man. The ecosystem's resilience and recovery capacity following such impacts must be determined. The efficacy of mitigation measures must also be considered. Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are excellent tools to use in such studies. This paper reviews the state of the art and application of these tools in tropical coastal zones, and illustrates their relevance in sustainable development. It highlights a selected number of remote sensing case-studies on land cover patterns, population structure and dynamics, and stand characteristics from South-East Asia, Africa and South-America, with a particular emphasis on mangroves. It further shows how remote sensing technology and other scientific tools can be integrated in long-term studies, both retrospective and predictive, in order to anticipate degradation and to take mitigating measures at an early stage. The paper also highlights the guidelines for sustainable management that can result from remote sensing and GIS studies, and identifies existent gaps and research priorities. There is a need for more comprehensive approaches that deal with new remote sensing technologies and analysis in a GIS-environment, and that integrate findings collected over longer periods with the aim of prediction. It is also imperative to collect and integrate data from different disciplines. These are essential in the spirit of sustainable development and management, particularly in developing countries, which are often more vulnerable to environmental degradation.},

Several experiments carried out on a complex forest area in Italy provide interesting conclusions on the effectiveness and potentialities of the joint use of hyperspectral and LIDAR data and on the accuracy of the different classification techniques analyzed in the proposed system. In particular, the elevation channel of the first LIDAR return was very effective for the separation of species with similar spectral signatures but different mean heights, and the SVM classifier proved to be very robust and accurate in the exploitation of the considered multisource data.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses spatial aspects of the global exposure dataset and mapping needs for earthquake risk assessment. We discuss this in the context of development of a Global Exposure Database for the Global Earthquake Model (GED4GEM), which requires compilation of a multi-scale inventory of assets at risk, for example, buildings, populations, and economic exposure. After defining the relevant spatial and geographic scales of interest, different procedures are proposed to disaggregate coarse-resolution data, to map them, and if necessary to infer missing data by using proxies. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these methodologies and detail the potentials of utilizing remote-sensing data. The latter is used especially to homogenize an existing coarser dataset and, where possible, replace it with detailed information extracted from remote sensing using the built-up indicators for different environments. Present research shows that the spatial aspects of earthquake risk computation are tightly connected with the availability of datasets of the resolution necessary for producing sufficiently detailed exposure. The global exposure database designed by the GED4GEM project is able to manage datasets and queries of multiple spatial scales.},

One is a so-called official site selection process, which is implemented by the Agency for radwaste management (ARAO); the other is an optimization process suggested by experts working in the area of environmental impact assessment (EIA) and land-use (spatial) planning. The criteria on which the comparison of the results of the two site selection processes has been based are spatial organization, environmental impact, safety in terms of potential exposure of the population to radioactivity released from the repository, and feasibility of the repository from the technical, financial/economic and social point of view (the latter relates to consent by the local community for siting the repository). The site selection processes have been compared with the support of the decision expert system named DEX. The results of the comparison indicate that the sites selected by ARAO meet fewer suitability criteria than those identified by applying strategic environmental considerations in the framework of the optimization process. This result stands when taking into account spatial, environmental, safety and technical feasibility points of view. Acceptability of a site by a local community could not have been tested, since the formal site selection process has not yet been concluded; this remains as an uncertain and open point of the comparison.},

Monitoring and documenting government strategies during the COVID-19 crisis is crucial to understand the progression of the epidemic. Following a content analysis strategy of existing public information sources, we developed a specific hierarchical coding scheme for NPIs. We generated a comprehensive structured dataset of government interventions and their respective timelines of implementation. To improve transparency and motivate collaborative validation process, information sources are shared via an open library. We also provide codes that enable users to visualise the dataset. Standardization and structure of the dataset facilitate inter-country comparison and the assessment of the impacts of different NPI categories on the epidemic parameters, population health indicators, the economy, and human rights, among others. This dataset provides an in-depth insight of the government strategies and can be a valuable tool for developing relevant preparedness plans for pandemic. We intend to further develop and update this dataset until the end of December 2020.},

Their limited accessibility has restricted seismological investigations in these regions, resulting in poor knowledge about the geodynamic processes. Here, we provide Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of crustal deformation across the frontal eastern Himalayan syntaxis (EHS). In this region, the Indian plate obliquely underthrusts the Eurasian plate, and the eastward‐extruding Tibetan plateau moves around the EHS due to India–Eurasia convergence. Our GPS measurements in the region suggest that the frontal EHS accommodates at least ∼20 mm/yr of oblique convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Under the frontal EHS, on which this convergence is accommodated through a stick‐and‐slip process, the 65 km wide main thrust zone of the plate boundary interface currently is locked. These measurements and the limited information about the great 1950 Assam earthquake (Mw 8.6) suggest that this great earthquake probably occurred in the EHS.},

Design/methodology/approach The paper critically analyses publicly available data. Findings The South African government's initial health response was praised by the international community, given the early lockdown and extensive testing regime. The lockdown devastated an already precarious economy, which led to negative social consequences. The initial lockdown delayed the epidemic, but subsequently, the infection rate climbed, requiring new restrictions, suggesting further economic disruption. The government has had to increase its borrowings, while the future tax take is forecast to be significantly reduced, a combination which will lead to a severely constrained public purse for many years to come. This will limit the government's ability to address the basic social needs that predated the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value This is one of the first academic papers to critically assess the effect of the South African government's response to the COVID-19 crisis on state finances and budgets.},

Many fields of study require monitoring of LULC change at a variety of scales. LULC change assessment is dependent upon high-quality input data, most often from remote sensing-derived products such as thematic maps. This research compares pixel- and object-based classifications of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for mapping and analysis of LULC change in the mixed land use region of eastern Ontario for the period 1995–2005. For single date thematic maps of 10 LULC classes, quantitative and visual analyses showed no significant accuracy difference between the two methods. The object-based method produced thematic maps with more uniform and meaningful LULC objects, but it suffered from absorption of small rare classes into larger objects and the incapability of spatial parameters (e.g. object shape) to contribute to class discrimination. Despite the similar map accuracies produced by the two methods, temporal change maps produced using post-classification comparison (PCC) and analysed using intensive visual analysis of errors of omission and commission revealed that the object-based maps depicted change more accurately than maximum likelihood classification (MLC)-derived change maps.},

In recent years, the earthquake risk of the valley has significantly increased due mainly to uncontrolled development, poor construction practices with no earthquake safety consideration, and lack of awareness among the general public and government authorities. Implementation of land use plan and building codes, strengthening of design and construction regulations, relocation of communities in risky areas, and conduction of public awareness programs are suitable means of earthquake disaster risk management practice. Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, is still lacking earthquake disaster risk management plans. So, this paper highlights some initiatives adopted by both governmental and nongovernmental organizations of Nepal to manage earthquake disaster risk in the Kathmandu Valley. It provides some comprehensive information on recent initiatives of earthquake disaster risk management in the valley and also highlights the outcomes and challenges.},

In Nepal, a devastating earthquake is inevitable in the long term and likely in the near future. So a non-structural earthquake vulnerability assessment study was carried out in the selected main hospitals of Nepal. This paper presents the findings of the assessment work. The results show an alarming situation and demand an immediate action in most of the hospital buildings so as to achieve a standard and acceptable level of safety. The study also recommends a gradual approach of increasing the safety level considering the socio-economic condition of the country and the fact that medium-level earthquakes are more frequent than the severe ones. Moreover, the non-structural component assessment study largely helped to convince the government officials and hospital authorities on the affordability and possibility of constructing earthquake-resistant non-structural components in the hospitals of developing countries such as Nepal, employing a slight improvement in the already employed methods of construction.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To compare the extent to which late 20th century patterns of mortality in London are predicted by contemporary patterns of poverty and by late 19th century patterns of poverty. To test the hypothesis that the pattern of mortality from causes known to be related to deprivation in early life can be better predicted by the distribution of poverty in the late 19th century than by that in the late 20th century. Design: Data from Charles Booth's survey of inner London in 1896 were digitised and matched to contemporary local government wards. Ward level indices of relative poverty were derived from Booth's survey and the 1991 UK census of population. All deaths which took place within the surveyed area between 1991 and 1995 were identified and assigned to contemporary local government wards. Standardised mortality ratios for various causes of death were calculated for each ward for all ages, under age 65, and over age 65. Simple correlation and partial correlation analysis were used to estimate the contribution of the indices of poverty from 1896 and 1991 in predicting ward level mortality ratios in the early 1990s. Setting: Inner London. Results: For many causes of death in London, measures of deprivation made around 1896 and 1991 both contributed strongly to predicting the current spatial distribution. Contemporary mortality from diseases which are known to be related to deprivation in early life (stomach cancer, stroke, lung cancer) is predicted more strongly by the distribution of poverty in 1896 than that in 1991. In addition, all cause mortality among people aged over 65 was slightly more strongly related to the geography of poverty in the late 19th century than to its contemporary distribution. Conclusions: Contemporary patterns of some diseases have their roots in the past. The fundamental relation between spatial patterns of social deprivation and spatial patterns of mortality is so robust that a century of change in inner London has failed to disrupt it.},

  abstract = {The radiometric normalization of multitemporal satellite optical images of the same terrain is often necessary for land cover change detection, e.g., relative differences. In previous studies, ground reference data or pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) were used in the radiometric rectification of multitemporal images. Ground reference data are costly and difficult to acquire for most satellite remotely sensed images and the selection of PIFs is generally subjective. In addition, previous research has been focused on radiometric normalization of two images acquired on different dates. The problem of conservation of radiometric resolution in the case of radiometric normalization between more than two images has not been addressed. This article reports on a new procedure for radiometric normalization between multitemporal images of the same area. The selection of PIFs is done statistically. With quality control, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to find linear relationships between multitemporal images of the same area. The satellite images are normalized radiometrically to a common scale tied to the reference radiometric levels. The procedure ensures the conservation of radiometric resolution for the multitemporal images involved. The new procedure is applied to three Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from three different years (August 1986, 1987, and 1991) and of the same area. Quality control measures show that the error in radiometric consistency between the multitemporal images is reduced effectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated using the radiometrically normalized multitemporal imagery and assessed in the context of land cover change analysis.},

The incentive policies that have being implemented in the country, since the last decade, promoted the implementation of some projects, mainly through the Alternative Energy Sources Incentive Program (PROINFA), which started in 2002. After the first phase of PROINFA, the wind power sector in Brazil is still waiting for a new long-term program. By applying a GIS model to the available wind database, this paper evaluates three long-term incentive programs to wind power in Brazil, according to specific targets and criterion. The first target was to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases from the electricity generation, through the replacement of fossil fuels fired-thermal plants. In this case, an incentive program based on quotes and permits would install a wind capacity hovering between 18.7 and 28.9 GW. For the target of optimizing the operation of Brazil's hydropower reservoirs, a program based on feed-in tariffs would result in the installed capacity of 15.5–65.4 GW, depending on the criterion for selecting the projects. Finally, considering only the target of fostering a domestic wind technology industry, the installed capacity would vary between 29.1 and 217.1, depending on the criterion for selecting the projects.},

In Port-au-Prince (Haiti)—the area affected by the 2010 earthquake—we map the building stock based on a pre-disaster imagery, and we show the added value of area-based information when added to point-based damage assessment from visual change interpretation of post-disaster aerial images. This paper shows that VHR imagery can be used to locate and quantify the building stock and its height. This paper also shows that damages measured from changes detected from pre- and post-disaster imagery can in principle map and provide vulnerability information related to the structural fragility of the building stock.},

Statistical inference is then used to quantify the building stock per class of building size. Legaspi in the Philippines is used as a case study. The results show that texture-based computer algorithms provide accurate area estimations of the built-up, that the detail of HR imagery allows the mapping of single buildings using photo-interpretation, and that a systematic sampling approach that uses building encoding and built-up maps can be used to quantify the building stock.},

  abstract = {Australia is a major food exporting country. Recent droughts reduced dryland farming production and the volume of water allocated to irrigated agriculture, with a resulting decline in aggregate agricultural production and exports. This paper analyses the possible impact of increased water scarcity on Australian agricultural production and the magnitude of subsequent impacts on global food security. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on land and water use coupled with a hydro-economic stochastic modelling approach, the impacts of reduced agricultural production in the southern Murray–Darling Basin, and more generally for Australia, are analysed. Changes in agricultural activity, reduction in agricultural exports and altered composition of products exported attributed to the severe 2000–2009 drought are also analysed to highlight the implications for global food security. The impact of climate change on food production is examined. The analysis shows that climate change, when modelled as the extreme case, along with other factors such as land use, will impact Australian food exports. Despite its relatively small contribution to total global food supply, Australia’s contribution to international trade in wheat, meat and dairy products is substantial and could affect global food prices. Furthermore, Australia’s agricultural exports are of disproportionate importance within the South- and South–East Asian and Oceania region, both in terms of volume and for strategic reasons. Adaptation along with investment in agriculture production is needed to maintain Australian agricultural production and enhance global food security.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that water scarcity is a complex problem when it affects countries with a semi-arid climate, ie countries for which there are fluctuations between a dry season and a season when rain occurs. The paper discusses the general vulnerability of the semi-arid zone in terms of four different types of water scarcity, the effects of which are being superimposed on each other: two are natural (type A, arid climate, type B, intermittent drought years) and two are man-induced (type C, desiccation of the landscape driven by land degradation, and type D, population-driven water stress). When fuelled by a rapid population increase, a risk spiral develops, manifesting itself in social and economic collapse during intermittent drought years. The paper concludes that many countries in Africa are heading for severe water scarcity -in fact two-thirds of the African population will live in severely water-stressed countries within a few decades. This severe water stress will largely be the result of unfettered population growth.},

We assess the effect of the pandemic on urban economic geography at the intra- and inter-regional geographic scales in the context of four main forces: the social scarring instilled by the pandemic; the lockdown as a forced experiment; the need to secure the urban built environment against future risks; and changes in the urban form and system. At the macrogeographic scale, we argue the pandemic is unlikely to significantly alter the winner-take-all economic geography and spatial inequality of the global city system. At the microgeographic scale, however, we suggest that it may bring about a series of short-term and some longer-running social changes in the structure and morphology of cities, suburbs and metropolitan regions. The durability and extent of these changes will depend on the timeline and length of the pandemic.},

Industrial chemicals, either in storage or transport, are now considered dangerously accessible materials that could be used to cause substantial harm. In response to this new threat, emergency organizations are beginning to plan for such possible chemical releases. Currently there is no tool that allows a community to track, analyze, query, and display data about these chemical “weapons of opportunity” and the readiness of the communities around them. Decision support systems are computer environments designed to assist decision makers within a particular problem-solving context. A particular type of DSS, environmental decision support systems (EDSS), assists environmental scientists and planners in making environmental management decisions. A hazardous materials decision support system called “FALCON” will assist emergency organizations by integrating information describing chemical inventories, security, health readiness, geography, and population into one information system. Emergency organizations will be able to assess response readiness of a community for chemical releases and prioritize antidote stockpiling, training, and security. Emergency organizations and first responders will use the FALCON DSS to simulate and prepare for real-time events, assess possible casualties, and receive emergency contact information. And with the help of FALCON, law enforcement and security personnel will be able to evaluate and augment protection of the most dangerous facilities.},

An important step in the development of methods for detecting, measuring, and monitoring change through time is the ability to compare images from different dates and sites in different scenes. These comparisons require the digital counts from each scene to be calibrated to common reference values. A method of relative calibration using robust regression and large numbers of likely invariant targets has been developed and implemented operationally. One or more images are calibrated to the digital numbers of a common reference scene. The technique has been used to calibrate over 100 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the Western Australian wheatbelt. The method and its application are described. The repeatability of the calibrations over a sequence of images of the same scene from different dates is examined.},

  abstract = {This paper compares the applicability of three ground survey methods for modelling terrain: one man electronic tachymetry (TPS), real time kinematic GPS (GPS), and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Vertical accuracy of digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from GPS, TLS and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is assessed. Point elevations acquired by the four methods represent two sections of a mountainous area in Cumbria, England. They were chosen so that the presence of non-terrain features is constrained to the smallest amount. The vertical accuracy of the DTMs was addressed by subtracting each DTM from TPS point elevations. The error was assessed using exploratory measures including statistics, histograms, and normal probability plots. The results showed that the internal measurement accuracy of TPS, GPS, and TLS was below a centimetre. TPS and GPS can be considered equally applicable alternatives for sampling the terrain in areas accessible on foot. The highest DTM vertical accuracy was achieved with GPS data, both on sloped terrain (RMSE 0.16 m) and flat terrain (RMSE 0.02 m). TLS surveying was the most efficient overall but veracity of terrain representation was subject to dense vegetation cover. Therefore, the DTM accuracy was the lowest for the sloped area with dense bracken (RMSE 0.52 m) although it was the second highest on the flat unobscured terrain (RMSE 0.07 m). ALS data represented the sloped terrain more realistically (RMSE 0.23 m) than the TLS. However, due to a systematic bias identified on the flat terrain the DTM accuracy was the lowest (RMSE 0.29 m) which was above the level stated by the data provider. Error distribution models were more closely approximated by normal distribution defined using median and normalized median absolute deviation which supports the use of the robust measures in DEM error modelling and its propagation.},

  abstract = {A procedure to achieve the semi-automatic relative image normalization of multitemporal remote images of an agricultural scene called ARIN was developed using the following procedures: 1) defining the same parcel of selected vegetative pseudo-invariant features (VPIFs) in each multitemporal image; 2) extracting data concerning the VPIF spectral bands from each image; 3) calculating the correction factors (CFs) for each image band to fit each image band to the average value of the image series; and 4) obtaining the normalized images by linear transformation of each original image band through the corresponding CF. ARIN software was developed to semi-automatically perform the ARIN procedure. We have validated ARIN using seven GeoEye-1 satellite images taken over the same location in Southern Spain from early April to October 2010 at an interval of approximately 3 to 4 weeks. The following three VPIFs were chosen: citrus orchards (CIT), olive orchards (OLI) and poplar groves (POP). In the ARIN-normalized images, the range, standard deviation (s. d.) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the spectral bands and vegetation indices were considerably reduced compared to the original images, regardless of the VPIF or the combination of VPIFs selected for normalization, which demonstrates the method’s efficacy. The correlation coefficients between the CFs among VPIFs for any spectral band (and all bands overall) were calculated to be at least 0.85 and were significant at P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.95, indicating that the normalization procedure was comparably performed regardless of the VPIF chosen. ARIN method was designed only for agricultural and forestry landscapes where VPIFs can be identified.},

Seven of the 13 OCPPs detected occurred at all sites: chlordanes, chlorpyrifos, dacthal, dieldrin, endosulfans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and trifluralin. Total SOCs ranged from 1.9–126 ng/m3 (mean = 25 ± 34) at source and 0.05–0.71 ng/m3 (mean = 0.24 ± 0.18) at downwind sites during dust conditions. Most SOC concentrations were 1–3 orders of magnitude higher in source than downwind sites. A Saharan source was confirmed for sampled air masses at downwind sites based on dust particle elemental composition and rare earth ratios, atmospheric back trajectory models, and field observations. SOC concentrations were considerably below existing occupational and/or regulatory limits; however, few regulatory limits exist for these persistent organic compounds. Long-term effects of chronic exposure to low concentrations of SOCs are unknown, as are possible additive or synergistic effects of mixtures of SOCs, biologically active trace metals, and mineral dust particles transported together in Saharan dust air masses.},

  abstract = {Map makers have for many years searched for a way to construct cartograms, maps in which the sizes of geographic regions such as countries or provinces appear in proportion to their population or some other analogous property. Such maps are invaluable for the representation of census results, election returns, disease incidence, and many other kinds of human data. Unfortunately, to scale regions and still have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions' shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read. Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps. We illustrate the method with applications to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the geographical distribution of stories appearing in the news.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing data and methods are widely deployed in order to contribute to the assessment of numerous components of earthquake risk. While for earthquake hazard-related investigations, the use of remotely sensed data is an established methodological element with a long research tradition, earthquake vulnerability–centred assessments incorporating remote sensing data are increasing primarily in recent years. This goes along with a changing perspective of the scientific community which considers the assessment of vulnerability and its constituent elements as a pivotal part of a comprehensive risk analysis. Thereby, the availability of new sensors systems enables an appreciable share of remote sensing first. In this manner, a survey of the interdisciplinary conceptual literature dealing with the scientific perception of risk, hazard and vulnerability reveals the demand for a comprehensive description of earthquake hazards as well as an assessment of the present and future conditions of the elements exposed. A review of earthquake-related remote sensing literature, realized both in a qualitative and quantitative manner, shows the already existing and published manifold capabilities of remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk. These include earthquake hazard-related analysis such as detection and measurement of lineaments and surface deformations in pre- and post-event applications. Furthermore, pre-event seismic vulnerability–centred assessment of the built and natural environment and damage assessments for post-event applications are presented. Based on the review and the discussion of scientific trends and current research projects, first steps towards a roadmap for remote sensing are drawn, explicitly taking scientific, technical, multi- and transdisciplinary as well as political perspectives into account, which is intended to open possible future research activities.},

  abstract = {The assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution aims at highlighting areas at a high risk of being polluted. This study presents a methodology, to estimate the risk of an aquifer to be polluted from concentrated and/or dispersed sources, which applies an overlay and index method involving several parameters. The parameters are categorized into three factor groups: factor group 1 includes parameters relevant to the internal aquifer system’s properties, thus determining the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to pollution; factor group 2 comprises parameters relevant to the external stresses to the system, such as human activities and rainfall effects; factor group 3 incorporates specific geological settings, such as the presence of geothermal fields or salt intrusion zones, into the computation process. Geographical information systems have been used for data acquisition and processing, coupled with a multicriteria evaluation technique enhanced with fuzzy factor standardization. Moreover, besides assigning weights to factors, a second set of weights, i.e., order weights, has been applied to factors on a pixel by pixel basis, thus allowing control of the level of risk in the vulnerability determination and the enhancement of local site characteristics. Individual analysis of each factor group resulted in three intermediate groundwater vulnerability to pollution maps, which were combined in order to produce the final composite groundwater vulnerability map for the study area. The method has been applied in the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (Northern Greece), an area of approximately 14,000 km\textsuperscript{2}. The methodology has been tested and calibrated against the measured nitrate concentration in wells, in the northwest part of the study area, providing results related to the aggregation and weighting procedure.},

This paper presents a study to assess and compare the impacts of the proposed ski areas within two valleys strongly linked to winter tourism: the Fiemme and Fassa Valleys. The method is based on the computation of spatial indicators using a Geographical Information System (GIS) to predict and quantify critical impacts, such as ecosystem loss and fragmentation, soil erosion, geomorphologic hazards, interference with flora and fauna, and visibility. Subsequently, multicriteria analysis was applied to generate composite indices, and to rank ski areas according to their overall suitability. Finally, sensitivity analyses allowed to test the stability of the results. The study concluded that two of the proposed ski areas are located in highly unsuitable environment, and the relevant plan provisions should be revised.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the 21st century, a century in which the urbanization process of the previous one is ever on the rise, the novel smart city concept has rapidly evolved and now encompasses the broader aspect of sustainability. Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.},

  abstract = {Urbanization combined with climate change are exacerbating water scarcity for an increasing number of the world’s emerging cities. Water and sanitation infrastructure (WSS), which in the first place was largely built to cater only to a small subsector of developing city populations, is increasingly coming under excessive strain. In the rapidly growing cities of the developing world, infrastructure expansion does not always keep pace with population demand, leading to waterborne diseases such as cholera (Vibrio cholerae) and typhoid (Salmonella serotype Typhi). Funding gaps make targeting efficient spending on infrastructure essential for reducing the burden of disease. This paper applies geospatial analysis in Lusaka, Zambia for the cholera outbreak of October 2017—May 2018, to identify different WSS investment scenarios and their relative impact on reducing the risk of cholera in the city. The analysis uses cholera case location data and geospatial covariates, including the location of networked and non-networked WSS infrastructure, groundwater vulnerability, and drainage, to generate a high-resolution map of cholera risk across the city. The analysis presents scenarios of standalone or combined investments across sewerage expansion and maintenance; on-site sanitation improvements; piped water network expansion and quality; and ensuring the safety of point-source water. It identifies the investment most strongly correlated with the largest reduction in cholera risk as the provision of flush-to-sewer infrastructure citywide. However, it also considers the trade-offs in terms of financial cost vs. health benefits and takes note of where the next highest health benefits could be achieved for a much lower cost. Finally, the analysis was conducted during the restructuring of an existing World Bank investment, the Lusaka Sanitation Program (LSP), and identifies the most efficient investment at the time as partial sanitation scale-up and investment in piped water in wards where cholera risk was the highest.},

These satellites are able to quantify physical geography phenomena associated with the movements of the earth's surface (earthquakes, mass movements(, water (floods, tsunamis, storms), and fire (wildfires). Most of these satellites contain active or passive sensors that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0.5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily {$<$}2.3 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space.},

In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the informaiton in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms.},

No such cases are readily apparent for the current generation of geobrowsers, though the text of the 1998 Gore speech refers to several. An analysis of the use cases of geographic information systems (GIS) reveals similarities with the functionality of geobrowsers, inviting the view that the two forms of geographic information technology will eventually converge. However, experience suggests that users are finding very different ways of exploiting geobrowsers, and two examples are discussed in detail. These uses can be interpreted within a broad framework of spatial concepts, and the paper concludes that this framework provides a better guide to the future of geobrowsers and Digital Earth than current GIS technology.},

In some parts of the world dust storms occur frequently throughout the year. They can transport particulate material, pollutants, and potential allergens over thousands of km from source. The main sources include the Sahara, central and eastern Asia, the Middle East, and parts of the western USA. In some parts of the world, though not all, the frequency of dust storms is changing in response to land use and climatic changes, and in such locations the health implications may become more severe. Data on the PM10 and P2.5 loadings of dust events are discussed, as are various pollutants (heavy metals, pesticides, etc.) and biological components (spores, fungi, bacteria, etc.). Particulate loadings can far exceed healthy levels. Among the human health effects of dust storms are respiratory disorders (including asthma, tracheitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis and silicosis) cardiovascular disorders (including stroke), conjunctivitis, skin irritations, meningococcal meningitis, valley fever, diseases associated with toxic algal blooms and mortality and injuries related to transport accidents.},

At the same time, the kernel of computing platforms the CPU, also evolved from a single-core to multi-core architecture. This radical change significantly affected existing data processing algorithms. Exemplified by the problem of generating DEM from massive air-borne LiDAR point clouds, this paper studies how to leverage the power of multi-core platforms for large-scale geospatial data processing and demonstrates how multi-core technologies can improve performance. Pipelining is adopted to exploit the thread level parallelism of multi-core platforms. First, raw point clouds are partitioned into overlapped blocks. Second, these discrete blocks are interpolated concurrently on parallel pipelines. On the interpolation run, intermediate results are sorted and finally merged into an integrated DEM. This parallelization demonstrates the great potential of multi-core platforms with high data throughput and low memory footprint. This approach achieves excellent performance speedup with greatly reduced processing time. For example, on a 2.0 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon platform, the proposed parallel approach can process approximately one billion LiDAR points (16.4 GB) in about 12 min and produces a 27,500×30,500 raster DEM, using less than 800 MB main memory.},

  abstract = {Objectives Poverty, often defined as a lack of resources to achieve a living standard that is deemed acceptable by society, may be assessed using level of income or a measure of individual deprivation. However, the relationship between low income and deprivation is complex—for example, not everyone who has low income is deprived (and vice versa). In addition, longitudinal studies show only a small relationship between short-term changes in income and health but an alternative measure of poverty, such as deprivation, may have a stronger association with health over time. We aim to compare low income and individual deprivation as predictors of self-rated health (SRH), using longitudinal survey data, to test the hypothesis that different measures of poverty may have different associations with health. Methods We used three waves from the longitudinal Survey of Family, Income and Employment and fixed-effect linear regression models to compare low income ({$<$}50\% median income at each wave) and deprivation (reporting three or more items from the New Zealand individual deprivation index) as predictors of SRH (coded 1–5; SD 1.1–1.2). We also compared the impact of duration of low income and deprivation on SRH using mixed linear models. Results In the fixed-effect models, moving into deprivation between waves was associated with a larger decline in SRH compared to moving into low income, which persisted in models including both low income and deprivation. Similar findings were observed for duration of low income and deprivation in mixed models. Conclusions Moving into high levels of individual deprivation is a stronger predictor of changes in SRH than moving into low income. When investigating the association of hardship poverty with health, using alternative measures, in addition to income, is advisable.},

  abstract = {Bounded by the western and eastern syntaxes, the Himalayan region has experienced at least five M \textasciitilde{} 8 earthquakes during a seismically very active phase from 1897 through 1952. However, there has been a paucity of M \textasciitilde{} 8 earthquakes since 1952. Examining of various catalogues and seismograms from the Gottingen Observatory, it is established that this quiescence of M \textasciitilde{} 8 earthquakes is real. While it has not been possible to forecast earthquakes, there has been a success in making a medium term forecast of an M 7.3 earthquake in the adjoining Indo-Burmese arc. Similarly we find that in the central Himalayan region, earthquakes of M \&gt; 6.5 have been preceded by seismic swarms and quiescences. In the recent past, based on GPS data, estimates have been made of the accumulated strains and it is postulated that a number of M \textasciitilde{} 8 earthquakes are imminent in the Himalayan region. We examine these estimates and find that while earthquakes of M \textasciitilde{} 8 may occur in the region, however, the available GPS data and their interpretation do not necessarily suggest their size and time of occurrence and whether an earthquake in a particular segment will occur sooner in comparison to that in the neighboring segment. We also comment on the inference of occurrence of M \textasciitilde{} 8 earthquakes based on M8 algorithm for the region. We conclude that while an M \textasciitilde{} 8 earthquake could occur any time anywhere in the Himalayan region, there is no indication as of now as to where and when it would occur. We impress on the need for preparedness to mitigate the pending earthquake disaster in the region.},

  abstract = {Because atmospheric effects can have a significant impact on the data obtained from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing, it is frequently necessary to make corrections before any other image processing can be started. This paper describes a robust and relatively simple atmospheric correction method that uses pseudo-invariant targets (PITs) in conjunction with the empirical line method. The method is based on the selection of a number of suitable generic PITs, on the basis that they are large, distinctive in shape, and occur in many geographical areas. Whereas the multi-temporal normalization method corrects all images to a selected reference image, in this method images are simultaneously corrected using targets with a range of estimated surface reflectance values. The paper describes some applications of the method for a range of environmental studies involving water quality and air pollution monitoring, and mapping land-cover changes.},

  abstract = {Multiple objective decision support (MODS) is a structured framework for evaluating decision alternatives against multiple, and often conflicting, criteria. Its ability to handle complex trade-offs in a variety of quantitative and qualitative units gives it much potential in the field of natural resource management (NRM). A key component of MODS is the process used to obtain information from decision makers on the relative importance of evaluative criteria. Ranking algorithms then use this information to determine the relative value of each decision alternative. This paper explores how practising community based NRM decision makers respond to five generic methods for weighting the criteria. It presents a study in which 55 decision makers throughout five regions in Queensland, Australia, applied MODS to evaluate environmental projects seeking funding under the Australian Natural Heritage Trust. Weighting methods applied include fixed point scoring, rating, ordinal ranking, a graphical method and paired comparisons. Decision makers evaluated each weighting method in terms of ease of use and of how much it helped clarify the decision problem. Results show that decision makers felt uncomfortable applying fixed point scoring and generally preferred to express their preferences through ordinal ranking. This has implications for the types of ranking algorithms that can be applied to evaluate the decision alternatives.},

Policy responses are recorded on ordinal or continuous scales for 19 policy areas, capturing variation in degree of response. We present two motivating applications of the data, highlighting patterns in the timing of policy adoption and subsequent policy easing and reimposition, and illustrating how the data can be combined with behavioural and epidemiological indicators. This database enables researchers and policymakers to explore the empirical effects of policy responses on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as on economic and social welfare.},

  abstract = {Rapid loss estimation after potentially damaging earthquakes is critical for effective emergency response and public information. A methodology and software package, ELER-Earthquake Loss Estimation Routine, for rapid estimation of earthquake shaking and losses throughout the Euro-Mediterranean region was developed under the Joint Research Activity-3 (JRA3) of the EC FP6 Project entitled "Network of Research Infrastructures for European Seismology-NERIES". Recently, a new version (v2.0) of ELER software has been released. The multi-level methodology developed is capable of incorporating regional variability and uncertainty originating from ground motion predictions, fault finiteness, site modifications, inventory of physical and social elements subjected to earthquake hazard and the associated vulnerability relationships. Although primarily intended for quasi real-time estimation of earthquake shaking and losses, the routine is also equally capable of incorporating scenario-based earthquake loss assessments.  This paper introduces the urban earthquake loss assessment module (Level 2) of the ELER software which makes use of the most detailed inventory databases of physical and social elements at risk in combination with the analytical vulnerability relationships and building damage-related casualty vulnerability models for the estimation of building damage and casualty distributions, respectively. Spectral capacity-based loss assessment methodology and its vital components are presented. The analysis methods of the Level 2 module, i.e. Capacity Spectrum Method (ATC-40, 1996), Modified Acceleration-Displacement Response Spectrum Method (FEMA 440, 2005), Reduction Factor Method (Fajfar, 2000) and Coefficient Method (ASCE 41-06, 2006), are applied to the selected building types for validation and verification purposes. The damage estimates are compared to the results obtained from the other studies available in the literature, i.e. SELENA v4.0 (Molina et al., 2008) and ATC-55 (Yang, 2005). An urban loss assessment exercise for a scenario earthquake for the city of Istanbul is conducted and physical and social losses are presented. Damage to the urban environment is compared to the results obtained from similar software, i.e. KOERILoss (KOERI, 2002) and DBELA (Crowley et al., 2004). The European rapid loss estimation tool is expected to help enable effective emergency response, on both local and global level, as well as public information.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

Important issues in the provision of services include the location of the service centers, service capacities, geographical distribution of patients, and ease of access to the health services. This paper describes the development of a discrete-event geographical location–allocation simulation model for evaluating various options for the provision of services. Real-life case studies will illustrate the practical importance of the modeling approach.},

We assess the quality of G-DEM in comparison with 3-arc-second SRTM DEM, the best current global elevation dataset. Basic geomorphometric parameters (elevation, slope and curvature) were examined for a pre-release version of G-DEM and SRTM DEM for western Japan. G-DEM has fewer missing cells than SRTM DEM, particularly in steep terrain. Also, G-DEM gives smoother and more realistic representations of lowlands, valleys, steep slopes, and mountain ridges, whereas, SRTM DEM includes many local spikes and holes, and tends to overestimate valley-floor elevation and underestimate ridge elevation. G-DEM will be commonly used in geoscientific studies, because of its higher resolution, fewer missing data, and better topographic representation than SRTM DEM.},

It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator ‘LUCCA 4—Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding’, how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change. The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.},

First, the photographs of buildings in which casualties occurred were identified, and the building damage patterns were judged based on the photographs considering the existence of survival space. Then the relationship between the building damage pattern and casualty occurrence, and the characteristics of casualty distribution, were investigated. The main findings were as follows: Most casualties occurred in relatively old two-story wooden buildings in which the ground floor completely collapsed without survival space; casualties occurred at all building damage levels including ``no damage'', and it can be seen that building damage is the major, but not the sole cause, of casualties in an earthquake; in Nishinomiya City, the regional distributions of casualties due to the collapse of buildings that left no survival space is similar to that of casualties due to other types of building damage.},

  abstract = {Accurate characterisation of morphology is critical to many studies in the field of geomorphology, particularly those dealing with changes over time. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are commonly used to represent morphology in three dimensions. The quality of the DEM is largely a function of the accuracy of individual survey points, field survey strategy, and the method of interpolation. Recommendations concerning field survey strategy and appropriate methods of interpolation are currently lacking. Furthermore, the majority of studies to date consider error to be uniform across a surface. This study quantifies survey strategy and interpolation error for a gravel bar on the River Nent, Blagill, Cumbria, UK. Five sampling strategies were compared: (i) cross section; (ii) bar outline only; (iii) bar and chute outline; (iv) bar and chute outline with spot heights; and (v) aerial LiDAR equivalent, derived from degraded terrestrial laser scan (TLS) data. Digital Elevation Models were then produced using five different common interpolation algorithms. Each resultant DEM was differentiated from a terrestrial laser scan of the gravel bar surface in order to define the spatial distribution of vertical and volumetric error. Overall triangulation with linear interpolation (TIN) or point kriging appeared to provide the best interpolators for the bar surface. Lowest error on average was found for the simulated aerial LiDAR survey strategy, regardless of interpolation technique. However, comparably low errors were also found for the bar-chute-spot sampling strategy when TINs or point kriging was used as the interpolator. The magnitude of the errors between survey strategy exceeded those found between interpolation technique for a specific survey strategy. Strong relationships between local surface topographic variation (as defined by the standard deviation of vertical elevations in a 0.2-m diameter moving window), and DEM errors were also found, with much greater errors found at slope breaks such as bank edges. A series of curves are presented that demonstrate these relationships for each interpolation and survey strategy. The simulated aerial LiDAR data set displayed the lowest errors across the flatter surfaces; however, sharp slope breaks are better modelled by the morphologically based survey strategy. The curves presented have general application to spatially distributed data of river beds and may be applied to standard deviation grids to predict spatial error within a surface, depending upon sampling strategy and interpolation algorithm.},

This paper investigates the unique thematic classes that can be derived using integrated airborne LiDAR and spectral data. The study area consists of a heterogeneous, semi‐natural broadleaf woodland on an ancient site and homogeneous broadleaf and conifer woodland on an adjoining plantation. A parcel‐based unsupervised classification approach was employed, using the first two Principal Components from 12 selected wavebands of HyMap data and a Digital Canopy Height Model extracted from LiDAR data. The resultant 52 data clusters were amalgamated into 10 distinct thematic classes that contain information on species composition and vegetation structure. The thematic classes are relevant to the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) scheme for woodlands and scrub of Great Britain. Furthermore, in distinguishing structural subdivisions within the species‐based NVC classes, the thematic classification provides greater information for quantifying woodland habitat. The classes show degeneration from and regeneration to mature woodland communities and thus reflect the underlying processes of vegetation succession and woodland management. This thematic classification is ecologically relevant and is a forward development in woodland maps created from remote sensing data.},

Design: Cross sectional survey. Setting: 206 singlehanded practices and 606 partnerships in Trent region, United Kingdom. Method: Comparison of process and outcome measures derived from routinely collected data on hospital admissions and target payments for singlehanded practices and partnerships. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for the confounding effects of general practice characteristics—deprivation (Townsend score), percentage of Asian residents, percentage of black residents, proportion of men over 75 years, proportion of women over 75 years, rurality, presence of a female general practitioner, and vocational training status. Results: Differences in achievement of immunisation and cytology targets apparent on univariate analysis were not seen after adjustment for other general practice characteristics. Similarly, significant differences ({$>$}15\%; P{$<$}0.01) for three types of hospital admission seen on univariate analysis were not present after adjustment for other practice characteristics. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that singlehanded general practitioners are underperforming clinically. Our results offer insight into the structural difference between the two types of practice and underline the importance of the effect of other practice characteristics on process and outcome measures.

The main features of these datasets are reported from a geodetic point of view. Comparison at about 1 billion locations identifies artefacts (e.g. residual cloud patterns and stripe effects) in ASTER. For DEM-9S, the comparisons against the space-collected SRTM and ASTER models demonstrate that signal omission (due to the ∼270 m spacing) may cause errors of the order of 100–200 m in some rugged areas of Australia. Based on a set of geodetic ground control points over Western Australia, the vertical accuracy of DEM-9S is ∼9 m, SRTM ∼6 m and ASTER ∼15 m. However, these values vary as a function of the terrain type and shape. Thus, CGIAR-CSI SRTM ver4.1 may represent a viable alternative to DEM-9S for some applications. While ASTER GDEM has an unprecedented horizontal resolution of ∼30 m, systematic errors present in this research-grade version of the ASTER GDEM ver1 will impede its immediate use for some applications.},

  abstract = {The grain-scale morphology of fluvial sediments is an important control on the character and dynamics of river systems; however current understanding of its role is limited by the difficulties of robustly quantifying field surface morphology. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) offers a new methodology for the rapid acquisition of high-resolution and high-precision surface elevation data from in situ sediments. To date, most environmental and fluvial applications of TLS have focused on large-scale systems, capturing macroscale morphologies. Application of this new technology at scales necessary to characterize the complexity of grain-scale fluvial sediments therefore requires a robust assessment of the quality and sources of errors in close-range TLS data. This paper describes both laboratory and field experiments designed to evaluate close-range TLS for sedimentological applications and to develop protocols for data acquisition. In the former, controlled experiments comprising high-resolution scans of white, grey and black planes and a sphere were used to quantify the magnitude and source of three-dimensional (3D) point errors resulting from a combination of surface geometry, reflectivity effects and inherent instrument precision. Subsequently, a methodology for the collection and processing of grain-scale TLS data is described through an application to a coarse grained gravel system, the River Feshie (D50 32 to 63 mm). This stepwise strategy incorporates averaging repeat scans and filtering scan artefact and non-surface points using local 3D search algorithms. The sensitivity of the results to the filter parameter values are assessed by careful internal validation of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) created from the resulting point cloud data. The transferability of this methodology is assessed through application to a second river, Bury Green Brook, dominated by finer gravel (D50 18 to 33 mm). The factor limiting the resolution of DTMs created from this second dataset was found to be the relative sizes of the laser footprint and smallest grains. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These variations will likely create heterogeneous, landscape-scale fire danger conditions that have never been examined in detail. We modeled the evolution of fuel moistures and the Energy Release Component (ERC) from the US National Fire Danger Rating System across the 2009 fire season using very high resolution (30m) surface air temperature, humidity and snow ablation date models developed from a network of inexpensive weather sensors. Snow ablation date occurred as much as 28days later on North-facing slopes than on South-facing slopes at upper elevations. South-facing slopes were hotter and drier than North-facing slopes but slope position, in addition to aspect, was also important because nocturnal air temperatures were coolest and humidity was highest in valley bottoms. These factors created heterogeneous fuel moistures and fire danger across the study area. In the late season (August and September), nocturnal cold air drainage and high relative humidity fostered fuel moisture recovery in valley bottoms, where fuel moistures and ERC values were 30\% and 45\% higher and lower, respectively at peak fire danger (September 29th). Dry fuel moistures and relatively high ERC values persisted on low elevation, South-facing slopes. The driest conditions were observed 100–200m above the valley floor where mid-slope thermal belts frequently developed above areas of cold air pooling. We suggest that a complete understanding of these variations may help improve fire management decision making.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed multitemporal, multisensor data are often required in Earth observation applications. A common problem associated with the use of multisource image data is the grey value differences caused by non‐surface factors such as different illumination, atmospheric, or sensor conditions. Such differences make it difficult to compare images using the same colour metric system. Image normalization is required to reduce the radiometric influences caused by non‐surface factors and to ensure that the grey value differences between temporal images reflect actual changes on the surface of the Earth.A variety of image normalization methods, such as pseudoinvariant features (PIF), dark and bright set (DB), simple regression (SR), no‐change set determined from scattergrams (NC), and histogram matching (HM), have been published in scientific journals. These methods have been tested with either Landsat TM data, MSS data or both, and test results differ from author to author. However, whether or not existing methods could be adopted for normalizing high resolution multispectral satellite images, such as IKONOS and QuickBird, is still open for discussion because of the dramatic change in spatial resolution and the difference of available multispectral bands. In this research, the existing methods are introduced and employed to normalize the radiometric difference between IKONOS and QuickBird multispectral images taken in different years. Some improvements are introduced to the existing methods to overcome problems caused by band difference and to achieve more stable and better results. The normalized results are compared in terms of visual inspection and statistical analysis. This paper examined whether or not existing methods can be directly adopted for image normalization with high resolution satellite images, and showed how these methods can be modified for use with such images.},

  abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data provide accurate measurements of forest canopy structure in the vertical plane; however, current lidar sensors have limited coverage in the horizontal plane. Landsat data provide extensive coverage of generalized forest structural classes in the horizontal plane but are relatively insensitive to variation in forest canopy height. It would, therefore, be desirable to integrate lidar and Landsat data to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest structural attributes. We tested five aspatial and spatial methods for predicting canopy height, using an airborne lidar system (Aeroscan) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data: regression, kriging, cokriging, and kriging and cokriging of regression residuals. Our 200-km2 study area in western Oregon encompassed Oregon State University's McDonald–Dunn Research Forest, which is broadly representative of the age and structural classes common in the region. We sampled a spatially continuous lidar coverage in eight systematic patterns to determine which lidar sampling strategy would optimize lidar–Landsat integration in western Oregon forests: transects sampled at 2000, 1000, 500, and 250 m frequencies, and points sampled at these same spatial frequencies. The aspatial regression model results, regardless of sampling strategy, preserved actual vegetation pattern, but underestimated taller canopies and overestimated shorter canopies. The spatial models, kriging and cokriging, produced less biased results than regression but poorly reproduced vegetation pattern, especially at the sparser (2000 and 1000 m) sampling frequencies. The spatial model predictions were more accurate than the regression model predictions at locations \&lt;200 m from sample locations. Cokriging, using the ETM+ panchromatic band as the secondary variable, proved slightly more accurate than kriging. The integrated models that kriged or cokriged regression residuals were preferable to either the aspatial or spatial models alone because they preserved the vegetation pattern like regression yet improved estimation accuracies above those predicted from the regression models alone. The 250-m point sampling strategy proved most optimal because it oversampled the landscape relative to the geostatistical range of actual spatial variation, as indicated by the sample semivariograms, while making the sample data volume more manageable. We concluded that an integrated modeling strategy is most suitable for estimating and mapping canopy height at locations unsampled by lidar, and that a 250-m discrete point sampling strategy most efficiently samples an intensively managed forested landscape in western Oregon.},

  abstract = {Allocation for earthquake emergency shelters is a complicated geographic optimization problem because it involves multiple sites, strict constraints, and discrete feasible domain. Huge solution space makes the problem computationally intractable. Traditional brute-force methods can obtain exact optimal solutions. However, it is not sophisticated enough to solve the complex optimization problem with reasonable time especially in high-dimensional solution space. Artificial intelligent algorithms hold the promise of improving the effectiveness of location search. This article proposes a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to deal with the allocation problem of earthquake emergency shelter. A new discrete PSO and the feasibility-based rule are incorporated according to the discrete solution space and strict constraints. In addition, for enhancing search capability, simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is employed to escape from local optima. The modified algorithm has been applied to the allocation of earthquake emergency shelters in the Zhuguang Block of Guangzhou City, China. The experiments have shown that the algorithm can identify the number and locations of emergency shelters. The modified PSO algorithm shows a better performance than other hybrid algorithms presented in the article, and is an effective approach for the allocation problem of earthquake emergency shelters.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath. Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world.},

  abstract = {Geographic information systems (GIS) have been integrated to many applications in facility location problems today. However, there are still some GIS capabilities yet to be explored thoroughly. This study utilizes the capability of GIS to generate service areas as the travel time zones in a facility location model called the maximal service area problem (MSAP). The model is addressed to emergency facilities for which accessibility is an important requirement. The objective of the MSAP is to maximize the total service area of a specified number of facilities. In the MSAP, continuous space is deemed as the demand area, thus the optimality was measured by how large the area could be served by a set of facilities. Fire stations in South Jakarta, Indonesia, were chosen as a case study. Three heuristics, genetic algorithm (GA), tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA), were applied to solve the optimization problem of the MSAP. The final output of the study shows that the three heuristics managed to provide better coverage than the existing coverage with the same number of fire stations within the same travel time. GA reached 82.95\% coverage in 50.60 min, TS did 83.20\% in 3.73 min, and SA did 80.17\% in 52.42 min, while the existing coverage only reaches 73.82\%.},

  abstract = {The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) is a spaceborne LiDAR sensor. It is the first LiDAR instrument which can digitize the backscattered waveform and offer near global coverage. Among others, scientific objectives of the mission include precise measurement of vegetation canopy heights. Existing approaches of waveform processing for canopy height estimation suggest Gaussian decomposition of the waveform which has the limitation to properly characterize significant peaks and results in discrepant information. Moreover, in most cases, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are required for canopy height estimation. This paper presents a new automated method of GLAS waveform processing for extracting vegetation canopy height in the absence of a DTM. Canopy heights retrieved from GLAS waveforms were validated with field measured heights. The newly proposed method was able to explain 79\% of variation in canopy heights with an RMSE of 3.18 m, in the study area. The unexplained variation in canopy heights retrieved from GLAS data can be due to errors introduced by footprint eccentricity, decay of energy between emitted and received signals, uncertainty in the field measurements and limited number of sampled footprints. Results achieved with the newly proposed method were encouraging and demonstrated its potential of processing full-waveform LiDAR data for estimating forest canopy height. The study also had implications on future full-waveform spaceborne missions and their utility in vegetation studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the development of dashboards as dynamic, visual tools for communicating COVID-19 data has surged worldwide. Dashboards can inform decision-making and support behavior change. To do so, they must be actionable. The features that constitute an actionable dashboard in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of public web-based COVID-19 dashboards by assessing their purpose and users ("why"), content and data ("what"), and analyses and displays ("how" they communicate COVID-19 data), and ultimately to appraise the common features of highly actionable dashboards. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive assessment and scoring using nominal group technique with an international panel of experts (n=17) on a global sample of COVID-19 dashboards in July 2020. The sequence of steps included multimethod sampling of dashboards; development and piloting of an assessment tool; data extraction and an initial round of actionability scoring; a workshop based on a preliminary analysis of the results; and reconsideration of actionability scores followed by joint determination of common features of highly actionable dashboards. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to explore the findings by research question. RESULTS: A total of 158 dashboards from 53 countries were assessed. Dashboards were predominately developed by government authorities (100/158, 63.0\%) and were national (93/158, 58.9\%) in scope. We found that only 20 of the 158 dashboards (12.7\%) stated both their primary purpose and intended audience. Nearly all dashboards reported epidemiological indicators (155/158, 98.1\%), followed by health system management indicators (85/158, 53.8\%), whereas indicators on social and economic impact and behavioral insights were the least reported (7/158, 4.4\% and 2/158, 1.3\%, respectively). Approximately a quarter of the dashboards (39/158, 24.7\%) did not report their data sources. The dashboards predominately reported time trends and disaggregated data by two geographic levels and by age and sex. The dashboards used an average of 2.2 types of displays (SD 0.86); these were mostly graphs and maps, followed by tables. To support data interpretation, color-coding was common (93/158, 89.4\%), although only one-fifth of the dashboards (31/158, 19.6\%) included text explaining the quality and meaning of the data. In total, 20/158 dashboards (12.7\%) were appraised as highly actionable, and seven common features were identified between them. Actionable COVID-19 dashboards (1) know their audience and information needs; (2) manage the type, volume, and flow of displayed information; (3) report data sources and methods clearly; (4) link time trends to policy decisions; (5) provide data that are "close to home"; (6) break down the population into relevant subgroups; and (7) use storytelling and visual cues. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 dashboards are diverse in the why, what, and how by which they communicate insights on the pandemic and support data-driven decision-making. To leverage their full potential, dashboard developers should consider adopting the seven actionability features identified.},

  abstract = {The great earthquake belt which stretches from the Mediterranean through the Middle East into Central Asia results from the ongoing collision between the Eurasian plate and the African, Arabian and Indian plates to the south. Through much of this belt, the topography is created and controlled by fault movement in earthquakes. Many habitations are located at the foot of the fault-controlled mountain range-fronts that bound inhospitable deserts or elevated plateaus, in positions that are favourable for trade-routes, strategic control of access or for water supply. As a result, they are vulnerable to earthquakes, which often seem to have targeted population centres precisely. For many centuries, an uneasy accommodation was reached between human needs and the earthquake-controlled landscape, sometimes brilliantly exploited by local hydrological engineering, as in Iran. Occasional earthquakes would occur, killing a shocking proportion of the population, but the populations of the settlements themselves would be relatively small. Many once-small rural communities have now grown into towns, cities or megacities, while retaining their vulnerability through poor building standards. Earthquakes that occur in these places today now kill many more than they did in the past, as we have witnessed in the last few years. Extreme catastrophes have been rare only because the exposure of modern megacities to earthquake hazards has been relatively short (approx. 50 years); an increase in the number of such catastrophes now seems to be inevitable.},

  abstract = {A forest fire can be a real ecological disaster, regardless of whether it is caused by natural forces or human activity. It is impossible to control nature, but it is possible to map forest fire risk zones and thereby minimise the frequency of fire, avert damage, etc. Forest fire risk zones are locations where a fire is likely to start, and from where it can easily spread to other areas. Anticipation of factors influencing the occurrence of fire and understanding the dynamic behaviour of fire are critical aspects of fire management. A precise evaluation of forest fire problems and decisions on solution methods can only be satisfactorily made when a fire risk zone map is available. Satellite data plays a vital role in identifying and mapping forest fires and in recording the frequency at which different vegetation types/zones are affected. A geographic information system (GIS) can be used effectively to combine different forest-fire-causing factors for demarcating the forest fire risk zone map. Gorna Subwatershed, located in Madhya Pradesh, India, was selected for this study because it continually faces a forest fire problem. A colour composite image from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) 1D LISS III was used for vegetation mapping. Slope and other coverages (roads and settlements) were derived from topographic maps and field information. The thematic and topographic information was digitised and ARC/INFO GIS software was used for analysis. Forest fire risk zones were delineated by assigning subjective weights to the classes of all the layers according to their sensitivity to fire or their fire-inducing capability. Four categories of forest fire risk ranging from very high to low were derived automatically. Almost 30\% of the study area was predicted to be under very high and high-risk zones. The evolved GIS-based forest fire risk model of the study area was found to be in strong agreement with actual fire-affected sites.},

Since the initiation from the early 1970s, a total of nine meteorological satellites, FY series, including five polar-orbit satellites and four geostationary satellites, have been successfully launched. Chinese FY has become an important component of global meteorological satellites systems and continues to maintain long-term stable operations of both polar and stationary meteorological satellites. Later in 2002, China's HY-1, an oceanic color satellite, was launched and is now in good operation. The successive HY-2 and HY-3 of the HY series, including microwave sensors, are also on schedule. Relevant basic research, application, and operational service of satellite-borne remote sensing and Earth observation have been well implemented. In this paper, a brief overview of Chinese satellite-borne remote sensing, FY and HY series, is presented, and some progress is introduced.},

  abstract = {Icelandic glaciers cover ∼11 000 km2 in area and store ∼3600 km3 of ice. Starting in 2008 during the International Polar Year, accurate digital elevation models (DEMs) of the glaciers are being produced with airborne lidar. More than 90\% of the glaciers have been surveyed in this effort, including Vatnajökull, Hofsjökull, Mýrdalsjökull, Drangajökull, Eyjafjallajökull and several smaller glaciers. The publicly available DEMs are useful for glaciological and geological research, including studies of ice-volume changes, estimation of bias in mass-balance measurements, studies of jökulhlaups and subglacial lakes formed by subglacial geothermal areas, and for mapping of crevasses. The lidar mapping includes a 500–1000 m wide ice-free buffer zone around the ice margins which contains many glacio-geomorphological features, and therefore the new DEMs have proved useful in geological investigations of proglacial areas. Comparison of the lidar DEMs with older maps confirms the rapid ongoing volume changes of the Icelandic ice caps which have been shown by mass-balance measurements since 1995/96. In some cases, ice-volume changes derived by comparing the lidar measurements with older DEMs are in good agreement with accumulated ice-volume changes derived from traditional mass-balance measurements, but in other cases such a comparison indicates substantial biases in the traditional mass-balance records.}

  abstract = {This brief draws from the Tanzania WASH Poverty Diagnostic (TWPD) report (World Bank, forthcoming), an initiative of the World Bank Water Global Practice (GP), which brings together analytics from across sectors to identify practical, operationally relevant findings on the linkages between water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and poverty. The diagnostic identifies the B40 of the wealth distribution and focuses on the disparities they face in WASH access. It also identifies how these disparities and challenges affect other human development outcomes in sectors such as health and nutrition. Finally, it puts forward recommendations for how to address these deficits within the existing institutional context.In this brief, we cover the current state of WSS services in urban areas of Tanzania and trends over time, primarily focusing on Dar es Salaam, using available data from sources across different years. In accordance with the TWPD’s objectives, the analysis enables comparison between the T60 and the B40 of wealth distribution. First we look at overall coverage rates for both water supply and sanitation and their progress since 2005 according to the MDGs. Second, we reexamine these coverage rates according to SDG criteria. This means critically reanalyzing what we mean by “improved” to also include additional dimensions of safe WSS access, well beyond technology alone. We find that urban water coverage, though at first sight seeming more comprehensive and equal, is often unsafe, unreliable, and, for some, unaffordable. For sanitation, we find that improved coverage has gone up but still remains very low and in particular unsafe for a large percentage of the B40 poor population.},

Various aspects of remote sensing are routinely used to detect and map features and changes on land and sea surfaces, and in the atmosphere that affect urban sustainability. We provide a critical and comprehensive review of the characteristics of remote sensing systems, and in particular the trade-offs between various system parameters, as well as their use in two key research areas: (a) issues resulting from the expansion of urban environments, and (b) sustainable urban development. The analysis identifies three key trends in the existing literature: (a) the integration of heterogeneous remote sensing data, primarily for investigating or modelling urban environments as a complex system, (b) the development of new algorithms for effective extraction of urban features, and (c) the improvement in the accuracy of traditional spectral-based classification algorithms for addressing the spectral heterogeneity within urban areas. Growing interests in renewable energy have also resulted in the increased use of remote sensing—for planning, operation, and maintenance of energy infrastructures, in particular the ones with spatial variability, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The proliferation of sustainability thinking in all facets of urban development and management also acts as a catalyst for the increased use of, and advances in, remote sensing for urban applications.},

The maps together with the digitized information provide important tools to the management of mangroves of Kiunga MPA since various proposed treatments can now be entered and summarized thus providing useful overviews for planning, implementation and monitoring. The present inventory revealed that the existing mangrove forests within and adjacent to Kiunga MPA have a net standing volume of 2,354,004.85 m3 in 16,035.94 ha. There are eight species of mangrove trees, of which Rhizophora mucronata and Ceriops tagal are dominant. The standing volume ranges between 6.85 to 710.0 m3 ha−1 for stem with diameter above 5.0 cm. The average volume of the entire study area was 145.88 m3 ha−1, which corresponds to a stocking rate of 1736 stems per ha. Given its high potential productivity and regeneration, mangroves within and adjacent to Kiunga MPA have excellent prospects for sustainable exploitation.},

Fire management professionals can locate fire service vehicles and other resources online and in real-time. Fire patrol aircrafts and vehicles may use tracking devices to send their coordinates directly to the platform. Cameras can augment these data by transmitting images of high-risk areas into the graphical interface of the system. Furthermore, the system provides the geographical representation of fire ignition probability and identifies high-risk areas at different local regions daily, based on a high performance computing (HPC) pilot application that runs on Windows HPC Server. Real-time data from remote automatic weather stations and weather maps based on a weather forecasting system provide vital weather data needed for fire prevention and early warning. By using these methods and a variety of fire management information and tools, the end-users are given the ability to design an operational plan to encompass the forest fire, choosing the best ways to put the fire out within the proper recourses and time.},

  abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is inherent to remotely sensed data. Nearby pixels are more similar than distant ones. This property can help to improve the classification performance, by adding spatial or contextual features into the model. However, it can also lead to overestimation of generalisation capabilities, if the spatial dependence between training and test sets is ignored. In this paper, we review existing approaches that deal with spatial autocorrelation for image classification in remote sensing and demonstrate the importance of bias in accuracy metrics when spatial independence between the training and test sets is not respected. We compare three spatial and non-spatial cross-validation strategies at pixel and object levels and study how performances vary at different sample sizes. Experiments based on Sentinel-2 data for mapping two simple forest classes show that spatial leave-one-out cross-validation is the better strategy to provide unbiased estimates of predictive error. Its performance metrics are consistent with the real quality of the resulting map contrary to traditional non-spatial cross-validation that overestimates accuracy. This highlight the need to change practices in classification accuracy assessment. To encourage it we developped Museo ToolBox, an open-source python library that makes spatial cross-validation possible.},

  abstract = {In steep and rocky terrains, their rough surfaces make it difficult to create landslide inventories even with detailed maps/images produced from airborne LiDAR data. To provide objective clues in locating deep-seated landslides, the surface textures of a 5~km2 steepland area in Japan was investigated using the eigenvalue ratio and slope filters calculated from a very high resolution LiDAR-derived DEM. The range of filter values was determined for each of a number of surface features mapped in the field and these included: cracked bedrock outcrops, coarse colluvial deposits, gently undulating surfaces, and smooth surfaces. Recently active slides commonly contained patches of ground in which deposition and erosion occurred together near the erosion front, or where cracked bedrock outcrops and coarse colluvial deposits coexisted under a gently undulating surface. The characteristic eigenvalue and slope filter values representing this sliding process were applied to maps of the DEM derived filter values to extract potential sites of recent landslide activity. In addition, the relationships between the filter values of deep-seated landslides at various stages of evolution within the field mapped area were extended to the entire study area, to assess the contribution that landslide evolution makes to change in the landscape as a whole. While landslide components made up the steepest as well as the gentlest parts of the landscape depending on their evolutionary stage, landslides were constantly coarsened and steepened by progressive erosion, probably initiated by river bank erosion at the foot of slopes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) play a pivotal role in controlling typhoid fever, as it is primarily transmitted through oral-fecal pathways. Given our constrained resources, staying current with the most recent research is crucial. This ensures we remain informed about practical insights regarding effective typhoid fever control strategies across various WASH components.~We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies to estimate the associations of water, sanitation, and hygiene exposures with typhoid fever. METHODS: We updated the previous review conducted by Brockett et al. We included new findings published between June 2018 and October 2022 in Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We used the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for risk of bias (ROB) assessment. We classified WASH exposures according to the classification provided by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (JMP) update in 2015. We conducted the meta-analyses by only including studies that did not have a critical ROB in both Bayesian and frequentist random-effects models. RESULTS: We identified 8 new studies and analyzed 27 studies in total. Our analyses showed that while the general insights on the protective (or harmful) impact of improved (or unimproved) WASH remain the same, the pooled estimates of OR differed. Pooled estimates of limited hygiene (OR\,=\,2.26, 95\% CrI: 1.38 to 3.64), untreated water (OR\,=\,1.96, 95\% CrI: 1.28 to 3.27) and surface water (OR\,=\,2.14, 95\% CrI: 1.03 to 4.06) showed 3\% increase, 18\% decrease, and 16\% increase, respectively, from the existing estimates. On the other hand, improved WASH reduced the odds of typhoid fever with pooled estimates for improved water source (OR\,=\,0.54, 95\% CrI: 0.31 to 1.08), basic hygiene (OR\,=\,0.6, 95\% CrI: 0.38 to 0.97) and treated water (OR\,=\,0.54, 95\% CrI: 0.36 to 0.8) showing 26\% decrease, 15\% increase, and 8\% decrease, respectively, from the existing estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The updated pooled estimates of ORs for the association of WASH with typhoid fever showed clear changes from the existing estimates. Our study affirms that relatively low-cost WASH strategies such as basic hygiene or water treatment can be an effective tool to provide protection against typhoid fever in addition to other resource-intensive ways to improve WASH.

However, most of them rely stereo analysis or additional data sources such as LIDAR for retrieval of 3D building information. This paper proposes a semiautomatic approach that extracts 3D building information from single satellite images. In this approach, after measuring boundaries of a building roof we determine the building height by projecting building shadow onto the image space until the projected shadow matches the actual shadow. Then we extract building footprints by translating roof boundaries along the direction of vertical edges to the amount determined by the building height. To increase the level of automation, we devised a technique that adjusts the height so that the projected shadow matches the actual shadow and determine building height automatically. We also devised a technique to extract roof boundaries by clicking only two corner points. A panchromatic IKONOS image and Quickbird image over Deajeon area were used to test proposed algorithms and a IKONO stereo pair was used to get reference building heights. While building heights determined manually showed the accuracy of an RMS error of 1.66 m, the heights determined automatically showed an RMS error of 1.86 m. The results show that 3D building information can be extracted from single satellite images and that the automation approaches proposed in this paper worked.},

HAZUS Earthquake modules calculate seismic hazard, evaluate the likelihood of various states of damage to buildings, lifelines, and other components of the built environment, and estimate both direct and indirect losses resulting from this damage. The focus of this paper is on building-related methods. The paper also describes two recent improvements to the HAZUS Earthquake technology: (1) the Advanced Engineering Building Module (AEBM) and (2) use of ShakeMap ground motion data. The AEBM allows expert users to develop “building-specific” damage and loss functions. ShakeMap ground motion data HAZUS may be used to rapidly assess potential damage and loss immediately following an earthquake. The paper closes with a comparison of damage and loss estimated using ShakeMap data with actual damage and loss due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for digital terrain model (DTM) generation from an airborne laser scanning point cloud, called repetitive interpolation (REIN). It is especially applicable in steep, forested areas where other filtering algorithms typically have problems distinguishing between ground returns and off-ground points reflected in the vegetation. REIN can produce a DTM either in a vector grid or in a TIN data structure. REIN is applied after an initial filtering, which involves removal of all negative outliers and removal of many, but not necessarily all, off-ground points by some existing filtering algorithm. REIN makes use of the redundancy in the initially filtered point cloud (FPC) in order to mitigate the effect of the residual off-ground points. Multiple independent random samples are taken from the initial FPC. From each sample, ground elevation estimates are interpolated at individual DTM locations. Because the lower bounds of the distributions of the elevation estimates at each DTM location are almost insensitive to positive outliers, the true ground elevations can be approximated by adding the global mean offset to the lower bounds, which is estimated from the data. The random sampling makes REIN unique among the methods of filtering airborne laser data. While other filters behave deterministically, always generating a filter error in special situations, in REIN, because of its random aspects, these errors do not occur in each sample, and typically cancel out in the final computation of DTM elevations. Reduction of processing time by parallelization of REIN is possible. REIN was tested in a test area of 2~hectares, encompassing steep relief covered by mixed forest. An Optech ALTM 1020 lidar was used, with a flying height of 260–300~m above the ground, the beam divergence was 0.3~mrad, and the obtained point cloud density for the last returns was 8.5~m− 2. A DTM grid was generated with 1~m horizontal resolution. The root mean square elevation error of the DTM ranged between ± 0.16~m and ± 0.37~m, depending on REIN sampling rate and number of samples taken, the lowest value achieved with 4 samples and using a 23\% sampling rate. The paper also gives a short overview on existing filtering algorithms.},

  abstract = {Forest fire management practices are highly dependent on the proper monitoring of the spatial distribution of the natural and man-made fuel complexes at landscape level. Spatial patterns of fuel types as well as the three-dimensional structure and state of the vegetation are essential for the assessment and prediction of forest fire risk and fire behaviour. A combination of the two remote sensing systems, imaging spectrometry and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), is well suited to map fuel types and properties, especially within the complex wildland–urban interface. LiDAR observations sample the spatial information dimension providing explicit geometric information about the structure of the Earth's surface and super-imposed objects. Imaging spectrometry on the other hand samples the spectral dimension, which is sensitive for discrimination of surface types. As a non-parametric classifier support vector machines (SVM) are particularly well adapted to classify data of high dimensionality and from multiple sources as proposed in this work. The presented approach achieves an improved land cover mapping adapted to forest fire management needs. The map is based on a single SVM classifier combining the spectral and spatial information dimensions provided by imaging spectrometry and LiDAR.},

The article describes the integration of remote sensing data, aerial photographs, as well as point data provided by fieldwork from different scientific fields. Using various innovative processing techniques and different scale-resolution levels, an assessment of temporal–spatial changes of the mangrove peninsula and the adjacent rural socioeconomic impact area, the type of mangrove structure, as well as a land-use cover analyses was undertaken. The definition of the spatial level of detail was found to be a major issue in the development of the GIS, as well as during the processing and analysis procedures. A division between strong and weak patterns in the mangrove ecosystem could be made, which implies different management measures and sets of specific interdisciplinary studies and monitoring at hierarchical scales.},

  abstract = {Introduction A recent BMJ editorial on whether the NHS was improving after recent government investments concluded that we did not have the data to answer the question reliably.1 The latest NHS chief executive's report commented on the constraints of current measures of quality and productivity and on the need for better measures of output and outcome extending beyond hospital data.2 The Atkinson review of measurement of government output and productivity also acknowledged, in an interim report, the lack of measures of output and outcome attributable to the NHS.3 Reports of multidisciplinary working groups commissioned by the Department of Health describe potential health outcome indicators for 10 health topics, but many require new data collection that could take several years.4 Certainly, better data on outputs and outcomes, especially on those attributable to health service interventions, could help the NHS measure its success in its stated aim of improving the health and wellbeing of people in England.5 However, creative and informed use of existing data in the interim, acknowledging known shortcomings, may provide insights into the extent to which outcomes are changing.6 The main challenges are, firstly, to measure health validly and, secondly, to make judgments about the extent to which any improvements can be attributed to NHS interventions, given other influences on health outcome. In two articles we explore some of the technical issues involved and make practical suggestions about how best to use existing data. We have selected examples to illustrate a range of methodological issues covering specific sectors (hospital, primary care, community care), multiple sectors, individual conditions, multiple conditions, patients, and whole populations. This, the first, article covers indicators more directly related to clinical care—that is, hospital case fatality, hospital admissions for conditions treatable in primary care, cancer survival, and stroke. Our second article covers developmental approaches for mental health, potentially avoidable deaths, and forecasting coronary heart disease outcomes.7 Many other indicators could be produced along similar lines.8},

The spatial fire management system (sFMS) is a geographic information system based fire management information system that implements two core subsystems of the CFFDRS, along with other models and systems. The sFMS is the spatial engine that has been used to implement both of Canada's national forest fire management information systems, the Canadian wildland fire information system (CWFIS) and the fire monitoring, mapping and modeling system (Fire M3). The CWFIS is Canada's national fire management information system; it presents daily information on fire weather, fire behavior potential and selected upper atmospheric conditions. Fire M3 integrates the use of satellite technology for monitoring and mapping large fire occurrence in Canada. Fire M3 also incorporates information from CWFIS to model the impacts of large forest fires based on fire weather conditions and potential fire behavior.},

  abstract = {Development professionals have deployed several mobile phone-based ICT (Information and Communications Technology) platforms in the global South for improving water, health, and education services. In this paper, we focus on a mobile phone-based ICT platform for water services, called Sensors, Empowerment and Accountability in Tanzania (SEMA), developed by our team in the context of an action research project in Tanzania. Water users in villages and district water engineers in local governments may use it to monitor the functionality status of rural water points in the country. We describe the current architecture of the platform’s front-end (the SEMA app) and back-end and elaborate on its deployment in four districts in Tanzania. To conceptualize the evolution of the SEMA app, we use three concepts: transaction-intensiveness, discretion and crowdsourcing. The SEMA app effectively digitized only transaction-intensive tasks in the information flow between water users in villages and district water engineers. Further, it resolved two tensions over time: the tension over what to report (by decreasing the discretion of reporters) and over who should report (by constraining the reporting “crowd”).},

To date, insufficient attention has been given to the many error sources contributing to the uncertainty of scanner datasets. A full error budget for directly georeferenced terrestrial laser scanner networks that considers both relevant error sources fundamental to surveying and those unique to sampled laser scanner systems is derived. In the case of the latter, new probabilistic models are proposed for angular positional uncertainty due to laser beamwidth and centroid-based target pointing. Analysis of a cultural heritage-recording project in Ayutthaya, Thailand, highlights the disparity between “expected” precision and the more realistic precision indicated by the error budget and demonstrates that the beamwidth error can be a significant factor. The causes and effects of several systematic errors inherent to TLS datasets are also discussed.},

The algorithm exploits the four-channel (blue, green, red and near infrared) multispectral imaging capability of some terrestrial scanners using supervised, parametric classification to assign thematic class labels to all scan cloud points. Its principal advantage is that it is a completely data-driven algorithm and is independent of spatial sampling resolution since the processing is performed in four-dimensional spectral feature space. Its application to two data-sets of different spatial extent and spatial and spectral complexity is reported, for which respective overall classification accuracies of 87·0\% and 82·0\% were achieved. Analysis of the input data with emphasis on the characteristics pertinent to the anticipated outcomes precedes detailed analysis of the classification results and error sources and their causes. Erroneously classified points are attributed to radiometric errors stemming from both detector hardware and physical effects.},

The ASTER GDEM covers land surfaces between 83° N and 83° S at a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second (approximately 30 m at the equator). As an improvement over Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) coverage, the ASTER GDEM will be a very useful product for many applications, such as relief analysis, hydrological studies, and radar interferometry. In this article, its absolute vertical accuracy in China was assessed at five study sites using ground control points (GCPs) from high-accuracy GPS benchmarks and also using a DEM-to-DEM comparison with the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) SRTM DEM Version 4.1. It is demonstrated that the vertical accuracy of ASTER GDEM is 26 m (root mean square error (RMSE)) against GPS-GCPs, while for the SRTM DEM it is 23 m. Furthermore, height differences in the GDEM-SRTM comparison appear to be overestimated in the areas with a south or southwest aspect in the five study areas. To a certain extent, the error can be attributed to variations in heights due to land-cover effects and undefined inland waterbodies. But the ASTER GDEM needs further error-mitigating improvements to meet the expected accuracy specification. However, as for its unprecedented detail, it is believed that the ASTER GDEM offers a major alternative in accessibility to high-quality elevation data.},

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of GeoAI research used in large-scale image analysis, and its methodological foundation, most recent progress in geospatial applications, and comparative advantages over traditional methods. We organize this review of GeoAI research according to different kinds of image or structured data, including satellite and drone images, street views, and geo-scientific data, as well as their applications in a variety of image analysis and machine vision tasks. While different applications tend to use diverse types of data and models, we summarized six major strengths of GeoAI research, including (1) enablement of large-scale analytics; (2) automation; (3) high accuracy; (4) sensitivity in detecting subtle changes; (5) tolerance of noise in data; and (6) rapid technological advancement. As GeoAI remains a rapidly evolving field, we also describe current knowledge gaps and discuss future research directions.},

These real-time interactive platforms allow citizens to understand the local, regional, and global spread of COVID-19 in a consolidated and intuitive manner. Despite this, little research has been conducted on how citizens respond to the data on the dashboards in terms of the pandemic and data governance issues such as privacy. In this paper, we seek to answer the research question: how can governments use data tools, such as dashboards, to balance the trade-offs between safeguarding public health and protecting data privacy during a public health crisis? This study used surveys and semi-structured interviews to understand the perspectives of the developers and users of COVID-19 dashboards in Hong Kong. A typology was also developed to assess how Hong Kong’s dashboards navigated trade-offs between data disclosure and privacy at a time of crisis compared to dashboards in other jurisdictions. Results reveal that two key factors were present in the design and improvement of COVID-19 dashboards in Hong Kong: informed actions based on open COVID-19 case data, and significant public trust built on data transparency. Finally, this study argues that norms surrounding reporting on COVID-19 cases, as well as cases for future pandemics, should be co-constructed among citizens and governments so that policies founded on such norms can be acknowledged as salient, credible, and legitimate.},

A conceptual model of human vulnerability to chemical accidents is developed, revealing the roots of human vulnerability and emphasizing its role in risk management. A geographical information system (GIS)-based methodology for mapping vulnerability is proposed and applied to the Nanjing Chemical Industry Park in China. By combining physical vulnerability and social vulnerability spatially, the total vulnerability is revealed to better respond to accidents. It is proposed to improve traffic lines and allocation of medical services, and include vulnerability assessment in land-use planning to reduce future risks. In other words, it seems feasible and effective to reveal physical, social and total vulnerability of residents in the vicinity of chemical risk sources.},

Historical urban policies, such as redlining, have contributed to current inequalities in exposure to intra-urban heat. However, it is unknown whether these spatial inequalities are associated with disparities in heat-related health outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the relationships between historical redlining, intra-urban heat conditions, and heat-related emergency department visits using data from 11 Texas cities. At the zip code level, the proportion of historical redlining was determined, and heat exposure was measured using daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST). Heat-related inpatient and outpatient rates were calculated based on emergency department visit data that included ten categories of heat-related diseases between 2016 and 2019. Regression or spatial error/lag models revealed significant associations between higher proportions of redlined areas in the neighborhood and higher LST (Coef.?=?0.0122, 95\% CI?=?0.0039?0.0205). After adjusting for indicators of social vulnerability, neighborhoods with higher proportions of redlining showed significantly elevated heat-related outpatient visit rate (Coef.?=?0.0036, 95\% CI?=?0.0007?0.0066) and inpatient admission rate (Coef.?=?0.0018, 95\% CI?=?0.0001?0.0035). These results highlight the role of historical discriminatory policies on the disparities of heat-related illness and suggest a need for equity-based urban heat planning and management strategies.},

Using LiDAR data for digital elevation model (DEM) generation is becoming a standard practice in spatial related areas. However, the effective processing of the raw LiDAR data and the generation of an efficient and high-quality DEM remain big challenges. This paper reviews the recent advances of airborne LiDAR systems and the use of LiDAR data for DEM generation, with special focus on LiDAR data filters, interpolation methods, DEM resolution, and LiDAR data reduction. Separating LiDAR points into ground and non-ground is the most critical and difficult step for DEM generation from LiDAR data. Commonly used and most recently developed LiDAR filtering methods are presented. Interpolation methods and choices of suitable interpolator and DEM resolution for LiDAR DEM generation are discussed in detail. In order to reduce the data redundancy and increase the efficiency in terms of storage and manipulation, LiDAR data reduction is required in the process of DEM generation. Feature specific elements such as breaklines contribute significantly to DEM quality. Therefore, data reduction should be conducted in such a way that critical elements are kept while less important elements are removed. Given the high-density characteristic of LiDAR data, breaklines can be directly extracted from LiDAR data. Extraction of breaklines and integration of the breaklines into DEM generation are presented.},

The results suggest that all three improvements have merit.

  abstract = {To increase understanding of forest carbon cycles and stocks, estimates of total and component (e.g. leaf, branch and trunk) biomass at a range of scales are desirable. Focusing on mixed species forests in central south‐east Queensland, two different approaches to the retrieval of biomass from small footprint Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) hyperspectral data were developed and compared. In the first, stems were located using a LiDAR crown openness index, and each was associated with crowns delineated and identified to species using CASI data. The component biomass for individual trees was then estimated using LiDAR‐derived height and stem diameter as input to species‐specific allometric equations. When summed to give total above‐ground biomass (AGB) and aggregated to the plot level, these estimates showed a reasonable correspondence with ground (plot‐based) estimates (r 2 = 0.56, RSE = 25.3 Mg ha−1, n = 21) given the complex forest being assessed. In the second approach, a Jackknife linear regression utilizing six LiDAR strata heights and crown cover at the plot‐scale produced more robust estimates of AGB that showed a closer correspondence with plot‐scale ground data (r 2 = 0.90, RSE = 11.8 Mg ha−1, n = 31). AGB aggregated from the tree‐level and Jackknife regression plot‐based AGB estimates (for 270 plots—each of 0.25 ha) compared well for more mature homogeneous and open forests. However, at the tree level, AGB was overestimated in taller forests dominated by trees with large spreading crowns, and underestimated AGB where an understorey with a high density of stems occurred. The study demonstrated options for quantifying component biomass and AGB through integration of LiDAR and CASI data but highlighted the requirement for methods that give improved estimation of tree density (by size class distributions) and species occurrence in complex forests.},

Western Australia has witnessed rapid economic expansion since the turn of the century founded upon extensive natural resource extraction. Thus, Perth, the state capital of Western Australia, has encountered significant population and urban growth in response to the booming state economy. However, the recent economic slowdown resulted in the largest decrease in natural resource values that Western Australia has ever experienced. Here, we present multi-temporal urban expansion statistics from 1990 to 2015 for Perth, derived from Landsat imagery. Current urban estimates used for future development plans and progress monitoring of infill and density targets are based upon aggregated census data and metrics unrepresentative of actual land cover change, underestimating overall urban area. Earth observation provides a temporally consistent methodology, identifying areal urban area at higher spatial and temporal resolution than current estimates. Our results indicate that the spatial extent of the Perth Metropolitan Region has increased 45\% between 1990 and 2015, over 320 km2. We highlight the applicability of earth observation data in accurately quantifying urban area for sustainable targeted planning practices.},

  abstract = {Urban land cover is one of the fastest global growing land cover types which permanently alters land surface properties and atmospheric interactions, often initiating an urban heat island effect. Urbanisation comprises a number of land cover changes within metropolitan regions. However, these complexities have been somewhat neglected in temperature analysis studies of the urban heat island effect, whereby over-simplification ignores the heterogeneity of urban surfaces and associated land surface temperature dynamics. Accurate spatial information pertaining to these land cover change—temperature relationships across space is essential for policy integration regarding future sustainable city planning to mitigate urban heat impacts. Through a multi-sensor approach, this research disentangles the complex spatial heterogeneous variations between changes in land cover (Landsat data) and land surface temperature (MODIS data), to understand the urban heat island effect dynamics in greater detail for appropriate policy integration. The application area is the rapidly expanding Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR) in Western Australia (WA). Results indicate that land cover change from forest to urban is associated with the greatest annual daytime and nighttime temperature change of 0.40 °C and 0.88 °C respectively. Conversely, change from grassland to urban minimises temperature change at 0.16 °C and 0.77 °C for annual daytime and nighttime temperature respectively. These findings are important to consider for proposed developments of the city as such detail is not currently considered in the urban growth plans for the PMR. The novel intra-urban research approach presented can be applied to other global metropolitan regions to facilitate future transition towards sustainable cities, whereby urban heat impacts can be better managed through optimised land use planning, moving cities towards alignment with the 2030 sustainable development goals and the City Resilience Framework (CRF).},

Yet, omission of UHI measures from global climate models and metropolitan planning methodologies precludes effective sustainable development governance. We present an approach that integrates Earth observation and climate data with three-dimensional urban models to determine optimal tree placement (per square meter) within proposed urban developments to enable more effective localized UHI mitigation. Such data-driven planning decisions will enhance the future sustainability of our cities to align with current global urban development agendas.},

  abstract = {Most nature and health research use the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for measuring greenness exposure. However, little is known about what NDVI measures in terms of vegetation types (e.g., canopy, grass coverage) within certain analysis zones (e.g., 500~m buffer). Additionally, exploration is needed to understand how to interpret changes in average NDVI (e.g., per 0.1 increments) exposure in relation to changes in vegetation amount and types. In this study, we aimed to explore what vegetation types and amounts best explain the average NDVI and how changes in average NDVI values indicate changes in different vegetation coverages. We used spatial modeling to sample mean NDVI and percentages of vegetation for sample locations within the Greater Manchester case study area. We fitted linear, nonlinear, and mixed multivariate and univariate generalized additive models (GAMs) for multiple spatial scales to identify the relationships between NDVI and vegetation amount and types. Our results showed that the relationships between NDVI and individual vegetation types mostly follow nonlinear trends. We found that canopy and shrubs coverage exhibited a greater influence on mean NDVI exposure values than grass coverage at 300 and 500~m indicating that NDVI values are sensitive to certain types and amounts of vegetation within various buffer zones. We also identified increment in mean NDVI exposure values at lower, mid, and high ranges might be associated with varying changes in total greenspace percentage and individual vegetation types. For instance, at 300~m buffer, an increment of mean NDVI in the lower range (e.g., from 0.2 to 0.3) is associated with an about 17\% increase in greenspace percentage. Overall, interpreting changes in NDVI values for urban greening interventions would require careful evaluation of the relative changes in types and quantities of vegetation for different buffer zones.},

  abstract = {Mapping informal settlements’ diverse morphological patterns remains intricate due to the unavailability and huge costs of high-resolution data, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of urban environments. The accessibility to high-spatial-resolution PlanetScope imagery, coupled with the convenience of simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) algorithm within the Google Earth Engine (GEE), presents the potential for Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to map the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets in a complex built-up environment of Durban. Such advances in multi-sensor satellite image inventories on GEE also afford the possibility to integrate data from sensors with different spectral characteristics and spatial resolutions for effective abstraction of informal settlement diversity. The main objective is to exploit Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope optical data fusion for more accurate and precise localization of informal settlements using GEOBIA, within GEE. The findings reveal that the Random Forests classification model achieved informal settlement identification accuracy of 87\% (F-score) and overall accuracy of 96\%. An assessment of agreement between observed informal settlement extents and ground truth dimensions was conducted through regression analysis, yielding root mean square log error (RMSLE) = 0.69 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) = 0.28. The results demonstrate reliability of the classification model in capturing variability of spatial characteristics of informal settlements. The research findings confirm efficacy of combined advantages of GEOBIA within GEE, and integrated datasets for more precise capturing of characteristic morphologic informal settlement features. The outcomes suggest a shift from standard static conventional approaches towards more dynamic, on-demand informal settlement mapping through cloud computing, a powerful analysis platform that simplifies access to and the processing of voluminous data. The study has important implications for identifying the most effective ways to map informal settlements in a complex urban landscape, thus providing a benchmark for other regions with significant landscape heterogeneity.},

This problem is further complicated by the non-convexity of regions typically encountered in practice.

To address this problem, theoretical conditions are established and associated methods are proposed for optimally siting a service facility in a region (convex or non-convex) with uniformly distributed demand. Through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), the developed approach is applied to identify facility sites that maximize regional coverage provided limitations on facility service ability.},

The sustainable management of natural resources has a growing research focus as the awareness of the complexity of interactions between socio-cultural, economical and biophysical system components is increasingly acknowledged. As better data and methods become available, the complexity of the system representation is augmenting. At the same time realism and relevance are increasing and allowing direct support for management and policy development. This article gives the background of recent developments in EDSS and summarises a selected set of papers that were presented at the 2nd Biennial Conference of the International Society of Environmental Modelling and Software (IEMSS 2004). Recent developments show a continuum between integrated assessment modelling and EDSS with varying levels of stakeholder participation in both EDSS development and application. There is a general tendency towards better utilisation of interdisciplinary data, integration and visualisation of temporal and spatial results. Future developments appear directed towards better representation of reality in models, improving user-friendliness and use in a negotiation or group discussion context.},

  abstract = {The footprints of the injustices of apartheid spatial planning remains visible in South Africa, especially in the nation’s peri-urban settlements, exemplified in poorly planned and densely populated townships. COVID-19 added to the socio-economic challenges of these areas due to their spatial configuration, dense population, generally poor sanitation and poor transport planning. These factors made the operationalization of the pandemic’s dictates, such as washing of hands and social distancing, difficult, if not impossible. This paper examines how the spatial organization and the various attributes of townships in South Africa affect government’s attempt at curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic in these areas. The paper contextualises the various government regulations aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, with a view to learning significant lessons for urban spatial restructuring. The paper is based mainly on a thematic and contextual analysis of secondary data, including published and unpublished literature, especially government regulations and activities on the pandemic in the study area. These are augmented with national and international documented experiences of the pandemic. Findings show that settlement overcrowding, poor restructuring and unresolved land restitution frustrate government’s interventions to control the spread of COVID-19 in KwaMashu and other South African townships. The paper concludes by making recommendations that highlight the need for innovative methods to accelerate the refurbishment of poorly planned townships; increased attention to informal settlement upgrading; and a land reform programme. These will make the actualisation of future government plans easier in the case of future epidemics and other emergencies.},

The results were derived from two separate reflectance models including a geometric–optical and a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, assuming nadir viewing. The effects of the atmosphere on the indices were also examined, using the 6S atmospheric code, and a short section is devoted to an analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Overall, the indices were not linear with respect to forest cover and, in many situations, an index did not have a unique value for a given cover. The general form of the indices’ responses to changes in cover could be explained by shadowing effects, linked to the heterogeneous nature of forest. The indices were also significantly affected by perturbations including solar zenith angle, background reflectance, stand structure, and leaf-area index. The relative importance of these perturbations depended on both the cover and on the particular spectral index tested. Existing indices should be selected according to the characteristics of the site under investigation, since no single index performed well over all covers. At low covers, GEMI performed best, where a decrease in the value of GEMI corresponded to an increase in crown cover. There was some evidence that the soil-adjusted indices (PVI, SAVI, TSAVI, and GEMI) partially reduced background reflectance effects in the data, although the reductions were not always associated with increased sensitivity to crown cover. At high covers, SAVI and TSAVI were found to perform best, since these indices had large dynamic ranges and small susceptibility to atmospheric perturbations. Further work is required to develop spectral indices specifically for conifer forests.},

  abstract = {A novel approach is taken to the problem of estimating global water scarcity, using a realistic and consistent procedure applied across many countries. Water demands, surface flows and groundwater availability are estimated on a gridded basis, and various water availability indices are derived comparing the resource with the projected demand. Surface flows are estimated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model linking climate to runoff and, in the major river basins, the runoff estimates for individual grid cells are accumulated to give estimates for the total flows at all points of interest. Groundwater availability is derived from hydrogeological maps based on estimates of the potential yield that can be expected from a borehole and the likely maximum borehole density. Estimates of potential groundwater recharge derived from the surface water model are also taken into account. Water demands are based on current and projected population and livestock numbers, and information on irrigation schemes and industrial water use. Results are presented for the application of the model to a region covering the whole of eastern and southern Africa. The main scenario considered includes the combined impact of climate change, population growth and improved living standards to the year 2050. The results for this scenario show that water scarcity is likely to increase in many countries in the region, with particular problems in the countries around Lake Victoria and in the southernmost parts of the pilot region.},

The high burden of diarrhea is mainly attributable to the limited access to improved water and sanitation. However, the impacts of improved sanitation and drinking water in preventing diarrheal diseases are not well understood. Therefore, this study estimated both the independent and joint effects of improved sanitation and water on diarrhea occurrence among rural under-five children in LMICs.},

  abstract = {Community hospital placement is dictated by a diverse set of geographical factors and historical contingency. In the summer of 2004, a multi-organizational committee headed by the State of Michigan's Department of Community Health approached the authors of this paper with questions about how spatial analyses might be employed to develop a revised community hospital approval procedure. Three objectives were set. First, the committee needed visualizations of both the spatial pattern of Michigan's population and its 139 community hospitals. Second, the committee required a clear, defensible assessment methodology to quantify access to existing hospitals statewide, taking into account factors such as distance to nearest hospital and road network density to estimate travel time. Third, the committee wanted to contrast the spatial distribution of existing community hospitals with a theoretical configuration that best met statewide demand. This paper presents our efforts to first describe the distribution of Michigan's current community hospital pattern and its people, and second, develop two models, access-based and demand-based, to identify areas with inadequate access to existing hospitals.

The article reviews geographic representations, their associated analytical possibilities and relevant computational tools in the combined spatial analysis and GIScience literatures.

  abstract = {Wind energy represents one of the most important renewable resources. Wind energy is a clean, renewable and its benefits are considered greater than the disadvantages. However, even though wind farms represent environmentally friendly projects, they frequently generate public resistance. One of the main disadvantages of wind farm construction projects is their poor aesthetic integration into the landscape. On the other hand, landscape impact of wind farms could be minimised if the visual impact is previously evaluated. As regards with the European legislation, the procedure of environmental impact assessment study is necessary before a wind farm project could be established. In contrast, there is not an objective methodology to assess the visual impact of wind farms. The aim of this work was to develop a methodology to predict and evaluate, before its construction, the visual impact of wind farms, taking into account the visualscape from different observation points. Proposed methodology could help to determine and evaluate the best location for new wind farm projects. Moreover, this method could be used as a consulting tool for public organization and private institutions, being quick, concise and clear.},

  abstract = {While international markets for woody biomass emerge, growing consumption of wood chips for energy in Denmark is leading to increasing import. With improved competitiveness and unquestionable environmental benefits, domestic wood chip supply is preferable, but measures must be taken to make the supply chain more cost efficient. One of the major contributors to the delivered costs of wood chips is transportation, which is highly determined by the geographical location of forests and energy plants. This paper presents a method based on continuous cost surface mapping using raster-based geographical information systems (GISs). The national wood chip resources have been mapped and for selected bioenergy plants the costs of transporting the annual fuel demand have been modelled using cost distance functions, supply curves and sensitivity analysis. Hence a geographically determined relation of cumulative wood chip resources and their average costs was established. The results may be used for socio-economically sound resource allocation, optimal plant fuel mix, and planning of future energy plants.},

Stool examinations were performed to measure nematode infection and reinfection 9 months after treatment, and an extensive questionnaire was applied to collect information on each child and on the conditions of the household. Comparison of areas with different levels of infrastructure showed the following trends as the level of community sanitation improved: clustering of cases by household became more significant, predisposition of individuals to reinfection and to heavy infection became more marked, and infections with different species were increasingly aggregated in the same individuals. These results suggest that sewerage and drainage can significantly reduce transmission of intestinal nematode infections in the public domain, but that other measures are required to control transmission within the household.},

Several procedures, including radiative transfer codes (RTCs) with simulated atmospheres, image-based procedures and dark-object subtraction (DOS), were evaluated by comparing surface reflectance factors derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital data with low-altitude, aircraft-based measurements for seven dates over a 1-year period. Acceptable results, approximately ± 0.02 reflectance (1 σ RMS), were achieved based on an RTC with appropriate simulated atmospheres. The DOS technique was the least accurate method and, in fact, produced greater error in estimations of near-IR reflectance than no correction at all. Two hybrid approaches, which combined the image-based nature of DOS with the precision of an RTC, provided sufficient accuracy and simplicity to warrant consideration for use on an operational basis. Though these results were probably site-specific (characterized by relatively low aerosol levels and low humidity), they illustrate the feasibility of simple atmospheric correction methods and the usefulness of a diverse data set for validation of such techniques.},

  abstract = {The seasonality of sunlight and rainfall regulates net primary production in tropical forests. Previous studies have suggested that light is more limiting than water for tropical forest productivity, consistent with greening of Amazon forests during the dry season in satellite data. We evaluated four potential mechanisms for the seasonal green-up phenomenon, including increases in leaf area or leaf reflectance, using a sophisticated radiative transfer model and independent satellite observations from lidar and optical sensors. Here we show that the apparent green up of Amazon forests in optical remote sensing data resulted from seasonal changes in near-infrared reflectance, an artefact of variations in sun-sensor geometry. Correcting this bidirectional reflectance effect eliminated seasonal changes in surface reflectance, consistent with independent lidar observations and model simulations with unchanging canopy properties. The stability of Amazon forest structure and reflectance over seasonal timescales challenges the paradigm of light-limited net primary production in Amazon forests and enhanced forest growth during drought conditions. Correcting optical remote sensing data for artefacts of sun-sensor geometry is essential to isolate the response of global vegetation to seasonal and interannual climate variability.},

In this paper, we review remote sensing implementations of support vector machines (SVMs), a promising machine learning methodology. This review is timely due to the exponentially increasing number of works published in recent years. SVMs are particularly appealing in the remote sensing field due to their ability to generalize well even with limited training samples, a common limitation for remote sensing applications. However, they also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect obtained results. A summary of empirical results is provided for various applications of over one hundred published works (as of April, 2010). It is our hope that this survey will provide guidelines for future applications of SVMs and possible areas of algorithm enhancement.},

  abstract = {Quantification of building vulnerability to earthquake and tsunami hazards is a key component for the implementation of structural mitigation strategies fostering the essential shift from post-disaster crisis reaction to preventive measures. Facing accelerating urban sprawl and rapid structural change in modern urban agglomerations in areas of high seismic and tsunami risk, the synergetic use of remote sensing and civil engineering methods offers a great potential to assess building structures up-to-date and area-wide. This paper provides a new methodology contextualizing key components in quantifying building vulnerability with regard to sequenced effects of seismic and tsunami impact. The study was carried out in Cilacap, a coastal City in Central Java, Indonesia. Central is the identification of significant correlations between building characteristics, easily detectable by remote sensing techniques, and detailed in situ measurements stating precise building vulnerability information. As a result, potential vertical evacuation shelters in the study area are detected and a realistic vulnerability assessment of the exposed building stock is given. These findings obtained allow for prioritization of intervention measures such as awareness and preparedness strategies and can be implemented in local disaster management.},

  abstract = {Soft-sediment deformation structures have been analyzed at six sites of the Kathmandu valley. Microgranulometric study reveals that silty levels (60 to 80\% silt) favor the development of soft-sediment deformation structures, while sandy levels (60 to 80\% sand) are passively deformed. Nonetheless well sorted sand levels (more than 80\% sand) generate over-fluid pressure during compaction if located beneath a silty cap, leading to fluidization and dike development. 3-D geometry of seismites indicates a very strong horizontal shearing during their development. Using a physical approach based on soil liquefaction during horizontal acceleration, we show that the fluidization zone progressively grows down-section during the shaking, but does not exactly begin at the surface. The comparison of bed-thickness and strength/depth evolution indicates three cases: i) no soft-sediment deformation occurs for thin (few centimeters) silty beds; ii) the thickness of soft-sediment deformation above sandy beds is controlled by the lithological contrast; iii) the thickness of soft-sediment deformation depends on the shaking intensity for very thick silty beds. These 3 cases are evidenced in the Kathmandu basin. We use the 30 cm-thick soft-sediment deformation level formed during the 1833 earthquake as a reference: the 1833 earthquake rupture zone extended very close to Kathmandu, inducing there MMI IX–X damages. A 90 cm-thick sediment deformation has therefore to be induced by an event greater than MMI X. From a compilation of paleo and historic seismology studies, it is found that the great (M \textasciitilde{} 8.1) historical earthquakes are not characteristic of the greatest earthquakes of Himalaya; hence earthquakes greater than M \textasciitilde{} 8.6 occurred. Kathmandu is located above one of the asperities that laterally limits the extent of mega-earthquake ruptures and two successive catastrophic events already affected Kathmandu, in 1255 located to the west of this asperity and in \textasciitilde{} 1100 to the east.},

  abstract = {Accessibility to health facilities is a critical factor in effective health treatment for people in rural areas of lesser-developed countries. In many areas accessibility is diminished by the lack of all-weather roads, making access subject to weather conditions. Location–allocation models have been used to prescribe optimal configurations of health facilities in order to maximize accessibility, but these models are based on the assumption that the underlying transport network is static and always available. Essentially, past work has ignored the potential impacts of improvements to the transport system in modeling access. In this paper we propose a model that treats the opposite side of the location/transport equation; that is, a model that treats existing facility locations as fixed and improves health service accessibility by upgrading links of the transport network to all-weather roads. This new model, called the Maximal Covering Network Improvement Problem (MC-NIP) is formulated as an integer-linear programming problem. An application of the MC-NIP model to the Suhum District of Ghana is presented, which shows that even a modest level of road improvement can lead to substantial increases in all-season access to health service.},

This paper provides an overview of location analysis and discusses GIS. The paper highlights how GIS has contributed to location science in terms of data input, visualization, problem solution and theoretical advances. The significance of GIS in this context is that it is far more than a mere spatial data input mechanism, which is a commonly held misconception within geography, operations research and other allied disciplines. In contrast to other reviews, the focus in this paper is to highlight the theoretical foundations of location analysis and modeling and how GIS is contributing to important advancements in this field. An overall contribution of the paper is providing a perspective on spatial analysis and how associated specialty areas are evolving and thriving, particularly as a component of GIScience.},

Past studies were focused on the timing of phenological events and their cues but not on the accompanying changes in leaf area that regulate vegetation–atmosphere exchanges of energy, momentum, and mass. Here we report, from analysis of 5 years of recent satellite data, seasonal swings in green leaf area of ≈25\% in a majority of the Amazon rainforests. This seasonal cycle is timed to the seasonality of solar radiation in a manner that is suggestive of anticipatory and opportunistic patterns of net leaf flushing during the early to mid part of the light-rich dry season and net leaf abscission during the cloudy wet season. These seasonal swings in leaf area may be critical to initiation of the transition from dry to wet season, seasonal carbon balance between photosynthetic gains and respiratory losses, and litterfall nutrient cycling in moist tropical forests.},

The increasing complexity of environmental decision problems, the growing number of subjects involved and keen competition between conflicting interests make decisions and decision support difficult. Decision support systems have been developed since the 1970s to help tackle semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. Despite their popularity, the success of DSS development is uncertain and many computerised decision-support tools have failed when dealing with complex and unstructured problems. This article describes the development methodology and progress of mDSS, a decision support system for water resource management that has been developed under the European research project MULINO. The mDSS tool is designed to integrate environmental (especially hydrological) models with multiple-criteria evaluation procedures. A number of prototypes have been developed and the final version is expected at the end of the 3-year project. The system's development is driven by the experience acquired in several case studies selected in five European countries. Although the main aim of the MULINO project and the DSS is to help with increasingly complex decisions of general water management, the concepts of sustainable river basin management introduced by the water framework directive are addressed as well.},

Yet the processes through which these decisions are reached and the data engineering advancements made for and during events are poorly reported. Understanding the capabilities and constraints in which city officials operate is essential for impactful academic research alongside global city comparison and discussion on best practices in reaching optimal and data-informed decisions. This is especially pertinent for the global South, where informality in housing and the economy presents further challenges to appropriate resource distribution in a crisis. Here, we present insights into the City of Cape Town’s data-driven response and subsequent data engineering and analytical developments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This is based upon a review of internal documentation including a close-out report which summarised semi-structured interviews with staff involved in the data work stream. The paper reports on the deliverables produced during 2020 by the data work stream and outlines specific challenges the city faced and its data-informed response in the areas of (1) quantifying costs for COVID-19 initiatives, (2) dealing with a surge in fatalities, (3) guiding scarce public resources to respond to an evolving crisis, and (4) data sharing. We demonstrate the real-term value of incorporating data into the decision-making process and conclude by outlining key factors that cities and researchers must consider as a part of the usual business to effectively assist their populations during times of stress and crisis.},

To confound this premise, other factors, such as atmospheric conditions and illumination geometry, can influence an object's spectral response. For this reason, a common first step in digital change detection is the task of image‐to‐image normalization. In this Technical Note, we present an efficient method for radiometric normalization of images by converting Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) pixel values into their respective ordinal ranks. To demonstrate this normalization approach, raw and ranked Landsat near‐infrared (NIR) image pairs, with a 6‐year lag, were differenced to detect change in forest cover located in central British Columbia, Canada. Results demonstrate that ranking values prior to image differencing improves detection of change. The ease and efficiency of the approach is promising for automation and studies of change over large areas.},

One such challenge is water security, an aspect that draws us to the subject matter of climate change adaptation. This article discusses findings about institutional complexities surrounding Day Zero, a concept associated with water taps running dry because of drought conditions as aggravated by climate change in the city of Cape Town, South Africa. The thrust on institutional complexities is deliberate, as this affects how crisis situations like Day Zero were handled. The data were generated mainly from the actor–actant–network theory, events study as well as document and discourse analysis methods. The actor–actant–network theory is used widely to trace how actors (humans) and actants (non-human phenomena) interact in space and time through their networks, following narratives like Day Zero, and act on climate-related matters. The analysis applied elements of grounded theory, resulting in categories and themes emerging for discussion. The article found that narratives surrounding Day Zero were embedded in both political and administrative dilemmas and red tape. Despite these challenges, the article concludes that Day Zero remains one of the landmark learning points for climate change adaptation and water security in Cape Town, South Africa, and in other cities across the world. The article recommends that Day Zero experiences continue to be embraced positively and documented further to enhance local government climate adaptation for water security currently and into the future as well.},

  abstract = {This paper describes new extensions to the previously published multivariate alteration detection (MAD) method for change detection in bi-temporal, multi- and hypervariate data such as remote sensing imagery. Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on "difficult" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes or- - dinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization},

  abstract = {The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) collected elevation data over 80\% of earth's land area during an 11‐day Space Shuttle mission. With a horizontal resolution of 3 arc sec, SRTM represents the best quality, freely available digital elevation models (DEMs) worldwide. Since the SRTM elevation data are unedited, they contain occasional voids, or gaps, where the terrain lay in the radar beam's shadow or in areas of extremely low radar backscatter, such as sea, dams, lakes and virtually any water‐covered surface. In contrast to the short duration of the SRTM mission, the ongoing Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is continuously collecting elevation information with a horizontal resolution of 15 m. In this paper we compared DEM products created from SRTM data with respective products created from ASTER stereo‐pairs. The study areas were located in Crete, Greece. Absolute DEMs produced photogrammetricaly from ASTER using differentially corrected GPS measurements provided the benchmark to infer vertical and planimetric accuracy of the 3 arc sec finished SRTM product. Spatial filters were used to detect and remove the voids, as well as to interpolate the missing values in DEMs. Comparison between SRTM‐ and ASTER‐derived DEMs allowed a qualitative assessment of the horizontal and vertical component of the error, while statistical measures were used to estimate their vertical accuracy. Elevation difference between SRTM and ASTER products was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), which was found to be less than 50 m.},

Methods\hspace{0.6em} We obtained high-resolution spatial and epidemiological data on health services, population, transport network, topography, land cover and paediatric fever treatment in four Kenyan districts to develop access and use models for government health services in Kenya. Community survey data were used to model use of government health services by febrile children. A model based on the transport network was then implemented and adjusted for actual use patterns. We compared the predictive accuracy of this refined model to that of Euclidean distance metrics. Results\hspace{0.6em} Higher-order facilities were more attractive to patients (54\%, 58\% and 60\% in three scenarios) than lower-order ones. The transport network model, adjusted for competition between facilities, was most accurate and selected as the best-fit model. It estimated that 63\% of the population of the study districts were within the 1~h national access benchmark, against 82\% estimated by the Euclidean model. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Extrapolating the results from the best-fit model in study districts to the national level shows that approximately six million people are currently incorrectly estimated to have access to government health services within 1~h. Simple Euclidean distance assumptions, which underpin needs assessments and against which millennium development goals are evaluated, thus require reconsideration.},

Four classes indicating level of security for real estate investments were developed: A (green) – best, B (blue) – still desirable, C (yellow) – declining, and D (red) – hazardous. Recent studies have shown that heat island effects are greater, imperviousness is higher, and tree cover lower in areas that were formerly redlined (class D). This paper analyzed all redlined areas in U.S. cities and confirms that redlined areas (class D) have lower tree cover, greater impervious cover and lower forest ecosystem service values than other classes, with tree cover declining and impervious cover increasing as security risk class increased. Nationally, tree cover averaged 40.1 percent in class A and 20.8 percent in Class D; impervious cover averaged 30.6 in Class A and 53.0 percent in Class D. Loss of annual ecosystem services in riskier redlined areas (classes B-D) compared to the highest rated zone (class A) conservatively equates to \$308 million nationally if classes B-D had the percent tree cover exhibited in Class A. At the city scale, these losses in foregone services can reach up to \$100 million per year (New York, NY). As percent tree cover and percent tree cover stocking declines as percent impervious cover increases, differences in the physical impervious structure of the redlined areas at the time of designation influence tree cover differences. As redlined areas were often delimited in areas with higher population density and impervious cover, these areas tend have lower tree cover today. Even if stocking levels were increased to levels exhibited in Class A (57.8\%) among all classes, tree cover would still decrease as class risk increases due to less available greenspace in lower graded classes. These patterns illustrate the importance of impervious cover on the distribution of ecosystem services and understanding the impacts of redlining practices. City policies could be directed to help offset these disparities by enhancing tree cover and reducing impervious cover in these under-resourced areas.},

  abstract = {Desaturation of ground by air injection attracts considerable attention in recent years as an innovative technique for a liquefaction countermeasure. Several research programs were conducted in laboratories regarding the related topics. This paper describes an in situ air-injection test that aims to examine the effectiveness of the air injection to desaturate ground and the validity of observation techniques to monitor the evolution of the unsaturated zone. In the test, air was injected from an air injector deployed in a targeted saturated-sand layer at a depth of 6 m. Observations revealed that the air-flow rate increased linearly with increasing air-injection pressure and the desaturated zone was generated within 4 m from the injection point. A 3-dimensional electric resistivity tomography technique was effective for evaluation of the desaturated zone. The degree of saturation of the in situ soil was observed by using high quality undisturbed samples obtained by the ground freezing method. The degree of saturation ranged from 68–98\%, which was low enough to almost double the liquefaction resistance of the soil at the site. Numerical analyses were also conducted with a gas-liquid two-phase flow simulator to describe the evolution of the soil desaturation. Qualitatively, predictions show a relatively good agreement with the in situ measurements of the 3D electric resistivity tomography and are quantitatively compatible with the in-field degree of saturation measured indirectly by using the frozen soil samples. Actual liquefaction resistance was evaluated utilizing the undisturbed samples by conducting a triaxial test under cyclic shear conditions, which revealed that desaturated samples were indeed less susceptible to liquefaction compared with the fully saturated samples.},

  abstract = {COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020, leading to some form of lockdown across almost all countries of the world. The extent of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 has a significant impact on our lives that must be studied carefully to combat it. This study highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on crucial aspects of daily life globally, including; Food security, Global economy, Education, Tourism, hospitality, sports and leisure, Gender Relation, Domestic Violence/Abuse, Mental Health and Environmental air pollution through a systematic search of the literature. The COVID-19 global lockdown was initiated to stem the spread of the virus and ‘flatten the curve’ of the pandemic. However, the impact of the lockdown has had far-reaching effects in different strata of life, including; changes in the accessibility and structure of education delivery to students, food insecurity as a result of unavailability and fluctuation in prices, the depression of the global economy, increase in mental health challenges, wellbeing and quality of life amongst others. This review article highlights the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown across the globe. As the global lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner in various countries of the world, it is necessary to explore its impacts to understand its consequences comprehensively. This will guide future decisions that will be made in a possible future wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global disease outbreak.},

The two land cover classification experiments use multispectral (Landsat‐7 ETM+) and hyperspectral (DAIS) data, respectively, for test areas in eastern England and central Spain. Our results show that the SVM achieves a higher level of classification accuracy than either the ML or the ANN classifier, and that the SVM can be used with small training datasets and high‐dimensional data.}

Domestic water use/demand is a complex element of socio-economic and physical characteristics, urban planning strategies, infrastructures and public water policies. Under a GIS environment, these factors correspond to different thematic layers, such as road network distance, distance from the city centre, distance from the coastline, topographic slope, land use/land cover, General Urban Plan of Mytilene, areas in which buildings with less than two storeys are allowed, the respective areas of buildings with more than two storeys, present population density and existing water supply and sewerage system. The Analytical Hierarchy Process applied in the evaluation of these factors led to spatial potential water demand map, which was classified into five priority zones. Results showed that a large percentage of the study area was identified as very high and high priority areas for future domestic water demand. The applied method was verified against the prepared maps showing the varying rates of water consumption and active water connections. The comparative evaluation of these maps validated the accuracy of the proposed method which can be used by the local officials of Mytilene in adopting policies and strategies aiming towards sustainable water resource management and development.},

According to UN-Habitat (2012), the proportion of urban populations living in slums is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (61.7\%); meanwhile, De Soto (2003) estimates the amount of “dead” capital at \$9.3 trillion. This capital is based mainly in slums. The paper presents two community mapping projects in urban areas of Nairobi and describes the advantages and disadvantages of the different methodologies used. Second, it explores the options for slum dwellers to map the areas where they live and the benefits of such mapping. Lastly, the paper shares the authors’ visions for participatory mapping and participatory GIS, and their ideas on how to select the optimal mapping method. The authors would like to open the discussion about possible effects of community mapping on local development and unlocking the hidden potential in urban-slum areas. Can the unlocking be achieved by acquiring spatial information about urban slums so that the inhabitants can make full use of their property? The paper discusses possible future development in the area of community mapping and invites researchers as well as practitioners to discuss whether community mapping is the key towards the sustainable development.},

In this paper, we evaluate the effects of two types of radiometric correction methods (absolute and relative) for the determination of land cover changes, using Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ images. In addition, we present an improvement made to the relative correction method addressed. Absolute correction includes a cross-calibration between TM and ETM+ images, and the application of an atmospheric correction protocol. Relative correction normalizes the images using pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) selected through band-to-band PCA analysis. We present a new algorithm for PIFs selection in order to improve normalization results. A post-correction evaluation index (Quadratic Difference Index (QD)), and post-classification and change detection results were used to evaluate the performance of the methods. Only the absolute correction method and the new relative correction method presented in this paper show good post-correction and post-classification results (QD index ≈ 0; overall accuracy {$>$}80\%; kappa {$>$}0.65) for all the images used. Land cover changes estimations based on uncorrected images present unrealistic change rates (two to three times those obtained with corrected images), which highlights the fact that radiometric corrections are necessary in multi-date multi-sensor land cover change analysis.},

A postal questionnaire survey was conducted in the Peak District National Park, England with 420 respondents drawn from National Park residents and visitors, urban dwellers and members of environmental organisations. The study suggests that: (1) there was a prevailing antipathy towards the landscape impacts of mobile telecommunications development in the National Park; (2) apart from emergency uses, the other socio-economic benefits of mobile telecommunications technology were thought to be relatively unimportant in the National Park; and (3) rather than socio-demographic characteristics, it was respondents' understandings of protected areas' needs for the technology and potential health risks that had significant effects on the perceived landscape impacts. Overall, this study suggests that the significance of National Park landscapes is respected by the public, even when setalongside the convenience of modern technology, which has substantial implications for landscape planning and management in protected areas.},

Although there are still difficulties regarding the understanding of its nature and technicalities, the need for it was acknowledged, and practice is taking place in diverse forms. Such diversity of approaches to SEA, while enriching debate, are critically confusing the relationship of SEA with other planning and impact assessment tools. In this paper it is argued that the value of SEA is a function of the extent it influences, and adds value, to decision making. Following that rationale, the paper suggests that SEA should be conceptualized as a framework, defined by core elements, that are incrementally integrated into policy and planning procedures and practices, whatever decision-making system in place. It is believed that in this way SEA may better satisfy one of its acknowledged aims and benefits, which is to help achieve sustainable development by changing the way decisions are made.},

The observations of the damage pattern during the 1934 Earthquake (Mw = 8.1), in particular, suggest that the spectral ground amplification due to fluvio-lacustrine sediments plays a major role in intensifying the ground motion in the basin. It is, therefore, imperative to conduct a detailed study about the floor variation of sediments in the basin. In this paper, a preliminary attempt was made to estimate the thickness of soft sediment in the Kathmandu Basin using microtremor observations. The measurements of microtremors were carried out at 172 sites spaced at a grid interval of 1 km. The results showed that the predominant frequency varies from 0.488 Hz to 8.9 Hz. A non-linear regression relationship between resonance frequency and sediment depth was proposed for the Kathmandu Basin. The thickness of lacustrine sediments at various points in the basin was estimated using the proposed equation, and then the estimated thickness was used to plot a digital elevation model of the basement topography and cross profiles of the sediment distribution in the basin. The results were validated by correlating the estimated sediment thickness with geology and geomorphology of the study area.},

  abstract = {Past researchers have anticipated the occurrence of a great earthquake in the central Himalayas in the near future. This may cause serious damage in the Kathmandu Valley, which sits on an ancient lake bed zone, with lacustrine sediments of more than 500 m depth. In this study, the predominant frequency of ground motion is evaluated using the Horizontal-to-Vertical (H/V) spectral ratio technique and recordings of ambient noise. The results of the H/V ratio show two peaks in about 20 percent of the locations, which are distributed mainly in and around the center and northern part of the Kathmandu Valley. The predominant frequencies vary from 0.5 Hz to 8.9 Hz in the study area, whereas the second resonance frequency varies from 4 Hz to 6 Hz in the center and northern part of the valley. This indicates that the center and northern part of the valley have a wide range of resonance frequency due to two levels of impedance contrast — one may be from the surface layer and the other may be from the layer underneath. These two levels of resonance indicate the importance of considering the effects of surface and lower layers during the planning and designing of infrastructures in the Kathmandu Valley.},

In this study, visibility of the noise source, visual attitude and vertical visual angle (VVA) in different landscapes were explored. Data from two cross-sectional field studies carried out among people living near wind turbines (n=1095) were used for structural equation modelling. A proposed model of the influence of visual attitude on noise annoyance, also comprising the influence of noise level and general attitude, was tested among respondents who could see vs. respondents who could not see wind turbines from their homes, living in flat vs. hilly/rocky terrain, and living in built-up vs. rural areas. Visual attitude towards the noise source was associated with noise annoyance to different degrees in different situations. A negative visual attitude, more than multi-modal effects between auditory and visual stimulation, enhanced the risk for noise annoyance and possibly also prevented psychophysiological restoration possibilities. Aesthetic evaluations of the noise source should be taken into account when exploring response to environmental noise.},

  abstract = {Emulating natural forest disturbance is an increasingly popular forest management paradigm that is considered a means of achieving forest sustainability. Adopting this goal requires a sound understanding of natural disturbances at scales that correspond to management policies and strategies. In boreal forest landscapes driven by periodic stand-replacing fires this requires knowledge of fire regime characteristics, especially their spatial and temporal variability as well as stochasticity. The major goal of this study was to demonstrate the utility of fire regime simulation modeling to explore the variability of fire regime characteristics, with respect to formulating and assessing forest management strategies. We conducted a modeling experiment in a boreal forest landscape of northwestern Ontario, Canada, to examine its long-term fire regime in relation to forest policies on harvest size distribution. We used BFOLDS, a spatially explicit fire regime model that simulates individual fire events mechanistically in response to fire weather, fuel patterns, and terrain. The fire regimes in four large eco-regions were modeled for a 200-year period under three fire-weather (cold, normal, and warm) scenarios, with replications. We found that fire size distribution in all eco-regions followed power law under all weather scenarios, but their slopes and intercepts varied among eco-regions and fire weather scenarios. Warming fire weather increased burn rates and fire numbers in all eco-regions, albeit to different degrees. Overall, the variability among eco-regions was higher than the variability among fire weather scenarios, and among replicates. Comparisons of simulated fire size classes with those from an 86-year long fire history showed that empirical data cannot capture the variability that could be revealed by simulation modeling. We also show that fire size distribution is spatially heterogeneous within eco-regions, and provide several suggestions for forest policy directions with respect to forest harvest size distributions and harvest rates, based on the variability of fire regime characteristics. An assessment of present forest policies of emulating natural disturbances that guide forest harvest sizes showed that these are incongruent with simulated fire size distributions under all scenarios with one exception. Overall, this study illustrates the value of scenario simulation modeling to explore and quantify the variability of forest fire regime, for use in forest policies and strategies that attempt to emulate natural disturbance.},

The assessment is performed for a scenario earthquake of moment magnitude 6.5, at an epicentral distance of 15 km, occurring during business hours. A level 2 HAZUS-MH analysis was performed where the building inventory, microzonation studies, and site-specific ground motion hazard maps (2\% exceedence probability in 50 years) were all improved based on local information. All collected data were assembled into a set of standard geodatabases that are compatible with the HAZUS-MH software using a GIS-specific procedure. The results indicate that the greatest losses are expected in unreinforced masonry buildings and commercial buildings. Sensitivity studies show that soil classes, the vulnerability of schools, and the spatial scale of loss estimations are also important factors to take into account.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective: To examine the relation between deprivation and acute emergency admissions for cancers of the colon, rectum, lung, and breast in south east England. Design: Ecological analysis with data from hospital episode statistics and 1991 census. Setting: North and South Thames Regional Health Authorities (population about 14 million), divided into 10 aggregations of 31 470 census enumeration districts (median population 462). Subjects: 146 639 admissions relating to 76 552 patients aged {$<$}100 years on admission, resident in the Thames regions, admitted between 1 April 1992 and 31 March 1995. Results: Residents living in deprived areas were more likely to be admitted as emergencies and has ordinary inpatient admissions and less likely to be admitted as day cases. Adjusted odds of ordinary admissions from the most deprived tenth occurring as emergencies (relative to admissions from the most affluent tenth) were 2.29 (95\% confidence interval 2.09 to 2.52) for colorectal cancer, 2.20 (1.99 to 2.43) for lung cancer, and 2.41 (2.17 to 2.67) for female breast cancer; adjusted odds of admissions as day cases were 0.70 (0.64 to 0.76), 0.50 (0.44 to 0.56), and 0.56 (0.50 to 0.62), respectively. Patients from deprived areas with lung or breast cancers were less likely to be recorded as having surgical interventions. Adjusted odds of patients from the most deprived tenth receiving surgery were 0.88 (0.78 to 1.00), 0.58 (0.48 to 0.70), and 0.63 (0.56 to 0.71), respectively. Admissions for colorectal cancer from the most deprived areas were less likely to be to hospitals admitting 100 or more new patients a year; the opposite held true for breast cancer admissions. No association was found for lung cancer admissions. Conclusions: Earlier diagnostic and referral procedures in primary care in deprived areas are required if there are to be significant reductions in mortality from these cancers. A national information strategy is required to ensure the continued availability of population based data on NHS patients and to mandate standardised datasets from the private sector. Rationalisation of acute services, hospital mergers, and plans for bed closures must take into account the increased healthcare needs and inequities in access to treatment and care of residents in areas with high levels of deprivation. Health authorities and primary care groups should re-examine their purchasing intentions, service reviews, and monitoring arrangements in the light of these findings.},

  abstract = {Boreal forests are a critical component of the global carbon cycle, and timely monitoring allows for assessing forest cover change and its impacts on carbon dynamics. Earth observation data sets are an important source of information that allow for systematic monitoring of the entire biome. Landsat imagery, provided free of charge by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) enable consistent and timely forest cover updates. However, irregular image acquisition within parts of the boreal biome coupled with an absence of atmospherically corrected data hamper regional-scale monitoring efforts using Landsat imagery. A method of boreal forest cover and change mapping using Landsat imagery has been developed and tested within European Russia between circa year 2000 and 2005. The approach employs a multi-year compositing methodology adapted for incomplete annual data availability, within-region variation in growing season length and frequent cloud cover. Relative radiometric normalization and cloud/shadow data screening algorithms were employed to create seamless image composites with remaining cloud/shadow contamination of less than 0.5\% of the total composite area. Supervised classification tree algorithms were applied to the time-sequential image composites to characterize forest cover and gross forest loss over the study period. Forest cover results when compared to independently-derived samples of Landsat data have high agreement (overall accuracy of 89\%, Kappa of 0.78), and conform with official forest cover statistics of the Russian government. Gross forest cover loss regional-scale mapping results are comparable with individual Landsat image pair change detection (overall accuracy of 98\%, Kappa of 0.71). The gross forest cover loss within European Russia 2000–2005 is estimated to be 2210 thousand hectares, and constitutes a 1.5\% reduction of year 2000 forest cover. At the regional scale, the highest proportional forest cover loss is estimated for the most populated regions (Leningradskaya and Moskovskaya Oblast). Our results highlight the forest cover depletion around large industrial cities as the hotspot of forest cover change in European Russia.},

Terrain analysis enables evaluation of landform changes in the two sub-watersheds which indicate differences in the denudational history of adjoining watersheds. It is demonstrated that the domainal variations in the lithology and structural complexity are reflected in differences in the denudational history which in turn is manifested in the geomorphic parameters.

It would seem that sufficiently high spectral resolution, of order 0.01 μm, would be adequate to permit unique discrimination of virtually any soils, vegetation types, and rocks, but we show by example that this is not necessarily the case.},

From the perspective of the SRTM-X system, we give in this paper an overview of the mission and the DEM production, as well as an evaluation of the DEM product quality. Special emphasis is on challenges and peculiarities of the processing that arose from the unique design of the SRTM system, which has been the first single-pass interferometer in space.},

  abstract = {The integration in electric power networks of new renewable energy facilities is the final result of a complex planning process. One of the important objectives of this process is the selection of suitable geographical locations where such facilities can be built. This selection procedure can be a difficult task because of the initially opposing positions of the different agents involved in this procedure, such as, for example, investors, utilities, governmental agencies or social groups. The conflicting interest of the agents can delay or block the construction of new facilities. This paper presents a new decision support system, based on Geographic Information Systems, designed to overcome the problems posed by the agents and thus achieve a consensual selection of locations and overcome the problems deriving from their preliminary differing preferences. This paper presents the description of the decision support system, as well as the results obtained for two groups of agents useful for the selection of locations for the construction of new wind farms in La Rioja (Spain).},

  abstract = {Natural disasters often result in large numbers of evacuees being temporarily housed in schools, churches, and other shelters. The sudden influx of people seeking shelter creates demands for emergency supplies, which must be delivered quickly. A dynamic allocation model is constructed to optimize pre-event planning for meeting short-term demands (over approximately the first 72 h) for emergency supplies under uncertainty about what demands will have to be met and where those demands will occur. The model also includes requirements for reliability in the solutions – i.e., the solution must ensure that all demands are met in scenarios comprising at least 100α\% of all outcomes. A case study application using shelter locations in North Carolina and a set of hurricane threat scenarios is used to illustrate the model and how it supports an emergency relief strategy.},

Comparison of the two DEMs allowed the mass balance of the glacier to be determined as more negative than -0.62 m yr(-1) water equivalent, about twice as negative as the value estimated from in situ measurements. Comparison of the DEMs also showed that the area of the glacier decreased by around 0.3\%, and the position of its margin retreated by around 14 m, from 2003 to 2005. It was also possible to track the motion of fine-scale features in the surface geometry such as meltwater channels, and hence to determine the glacier's surface velocity, in some areas. Typical average speeds were around 1-2 cm per day.},

Design Retrospective study using matched case–control areas. Setting Five circular regions of radius 10 km near industrial incinerators in England (case regions) and five matched control regions, 1998–2008. Participants All cases of diseases of interest within the circular areas. Primary and secondary outcome measures Counts of childhood cancer incidence ({$<$}15 years); childhood leukaemia incidence ({$<$}15 years); leukaemia incidence; liver cancer incidence; lung cancer incidence; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence; all-cause mortality; infant mortality ({$<$}1 year) and liver cancer mortality. Results The estimated relative risks for case circles versus control circles for the nine outcomes considered range from 0.94 to 1.14, and show neither elevated risk in case circles compared to control areas nor elevated risk with proximity to incinerators within case circles. Conclusions This study applies statistical methods for analysing spatially referenced health outcome data in regions with a hypothesised exposure relative to matched regions with no such exposure. There is no evidence of elevated risk of cancer incidence or mortality in the vicinity of large industrial incinerators in England.},

This study examines the impact of the geographical classification on the clustering of poor health per area and on the size of the differences in health by area deprivation. DESIGN Data on self reported health regarding 5121 people were analysed using three classifications: neighbourhoods, postcode sectors and boroughs. Multilevel logistic models were used to determine the clustering of poor health per area and the size of the differences in health by area deprivation, without and subsequently with adjustment for individual socioeconomic status. SETTING General population aged 16 years and over of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self rated health, mental symptoms (General Health Questionnaire, 12-item version), physical symptoms and long term functional limitations. MAIN RESULTS The clustering of poor health is largest in neighbourhoods and smallest in postcode sectors. Health differences by area deprivation differ only slightly for the three geographical classifications, both with and without adjustment for individual socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the choice of the geographical classification affects the degree of clustering of poor health by area but it has hardly any impact on the size of health differences by area deprivation.},

Normalization process minimizes the radiometric differences between two images caused by inequalities in the acquisition conditions rather than changes in surface reflectance. A wide range of RRN methods have been developed to adjust linear models. This paper proposes an automated Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) method to adjust a non-linear model based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and unchanged pixels. The proposed method includes the following stages: (1) automatic detection of unchanged pixels based on a new idea that uses CVA (Change Vector Análysis) method, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation and K-means clustering technique, (2) evaluation of different architectures of perceptron neural networks to find the best architecture for this specific task and (3) use of the aforementioned network for normalizing the subject image. The method has been implemented on two images taken by the TM sensor. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the presented technique in the automatic detection of unchanged pixels and minimizing imaging condition effects (i.e., atmosphere and other effective parameters).},

One of them has been developed by ourselves, for the Mediterranean areas. However environmental vulnerability to forest fires is an important part of risk; it represents, in fact, the exposed challenge to this scourge and therefore it worths particular attention by decision makers. Thus and due to the importance of socio-economic potential of forest and the negative influence of fire on this one, we propose in this work, a model for vulnerability assessment to forest fires based on the principle of the weighted sum. Application of the proposed model suggested to use of geomatics technologies to the spatialize level of vulnerability. Within this framework, a GIS was developed and applied to the forests of Djelfa in the Saharian Atlas, as originality, it will allow the understanding of the concept of vulnerability and risk associated the steppes area scale to reach a good space control.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the association between Saharan dust outbreaks and natural, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Methods A case–crossover design was adopted to assess the effects of Saharan dust days (SDD) on mortality in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. The population under study consisted of residents in the six main towns of the central-western part of the region who died between August 2002 and December 2006. The association of Saharan dust outbreaks and PM10 concentration with mortality was estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for apparent temperature, holidays, summer population decrease, flu epidemic weeks and heat wave days. The role of the interaction term between PM10 and SDD was analysed to test for effect modification induced by SDD on the PM10-mortality concentration–response function. Separate estimates were undertaken for hot and cold seasons. Results We found some evidence of increased respiratory mortality for people aged 75 or older on SDD. Respiratory mortality increased by 22.0\% (95\% CI 4.0\% to 43.1\%) on the SDD in the whole year model and by 33.9\% (8.4\% to 65.4\%) in the hot season model. Effects substantially attenuated for natural and cardiovascular mortality with ORs of 1.042 (95\% CI 0.992 to 1.095) and 1.043 (95\% CI 0.969 to 1.122), respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest an association between respiratory mortality in the elderly and Saharan dust outbreaks. We found no evidence of an effect modification of dust events on the concentration–response relationship between PM10 and daily deaths. Further work should be carried out to clarify the mechanism of action.},

This paper develops a two-stage stochastic optimization model to guide the allocation of budget to acquire and position relief assets, decisions that typically need to be made well in advance before a disaster strikes. The optimization focuses on minimizing the expected number of casualties, so our model includes first-stage decisions to represent the expansion of resources such as warehouses, medical facilities with personnel, ramp spaces, and shelters. Second-stage decisions concern the logistics of the problem, where allocated resources and contracted transportation assets are deployed to rescue critical population (in need of emergency evacuation), deliver required commodities to stay-back population, and transport the transfer population displaced by the disaster. Because of the uncertainty of the event's location and severity, these and other parameters are represented as scenarios. Computational results on notional test cases provide guidance on budget allocation and prove the potential benefit of using stochastic optimization.},

  abstract = {Recent reports investigate whether windblown desert dust may exacerbate the short-term health effects associated with particulate pollution in urban centers. We have tested this hypothesis by using daily air pollution and mortality data for Athens, Greece during the period 2001–2006. We investigated the effects of exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 0 μg/m3 (PM10) on total and cause specific mortality, during days with and without windblown desert dust, for all ages, stratified by age groups and by sex. We identified 141 dust days between 2001 and 2006. We used Poisson regression models with penalized splines to control for possible confounding by season, meteorology, day of the week and holiday effect. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 0.71\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.42\% to 0.99\%) increase in all deaths. The effects for total and cause specific mortality were greater for those ≥ 75 years of age, while for total mortality higher effects were observed among females. The main effect of desert dust days and its interaction with PM10 concentrations were significant in all cases except for respiratory mortality and cardiovascular mortality among those {$<$} 75 years. The negative interaction pointed towards lower particle effects on mortality during dust events. We found evidence of modification of the adverse health effects of PM10 on mortality in Athens, Greece with desert dust events: the particle effects were significantly higher during non-desert dust days. Our analyses indicate that traffic related particles, which prevail on non-desert dust days, have more toxic effects than the ones originating from long-range transport, such as Sahara dust.},

  abstract = {Water conservation is gaining ascendancy around the world as the most important strategy for water planning and management for the future decades. In the urban areas of the developed world, water conservation has to a certain extent achieved the objective of curbing consumption, especially in the more compact European cities. Urban water conservation depends on changing behaviors by water users, which may be influenced by personal factors (related to variables such as age, income, education, etc.) or may follow stimuli coming from the economic (i.e., pricing), technological, or public awareness spheres. The relative merit of each of these factors, as presented in this review, remains inconclusive, and conservation behaviors may vary in degree. However, conservation is also influenced by nonpurposeful factors, such as urban design, population, economic profile, and productive base. This article also discusses the governance context in which urban conservation practices take place. It is argued that conservation may influence governance (for instance, in the emergence of new, decentralized decision making networks) and also that governance, and especially the consolidation of certain nonpublic actors with specific agendas, may drive conservation practices.},

  abstract = {The future dynamics of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in African countries is largely unclear. Simultaneously, required strengths of intervention measures are strongly debated because containing COVID-19 in favor of the weak health care system largely conflicts with socio-economic hardships. Here we analyze the impact of interventions on outbreak dynamics for South Africa, exhibiting the largest case numbers across sub-saharan Africa, before and after their national lockdown. Past data indicate strongly reduced but still supracritical growth after lockdown. Moreover, large-scale agent-based simulations given different future scenarios for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality with 1.14 million inhabitants, based on detailed activity and mobility survey data of about 10\% of the population, similarly suggest that current containment may be insufficient to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger or more specific interventions, combined with sufficient compliance, may constitute a viable option for interventions for South Africa.},

  abstract = {The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high. These data have both become standard source of information for investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities. However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the added value for biodiversity research and monitoring. Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping species distribution and community composition, as well as for monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting widespread open access to satellite imagery. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could support the development of essential biodiversity variables.},

  abstract = {Area-based deprivation indices (ABDIs) have become a common tool with which to investigate the patterns and magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in health. ABDIs are also used as a proxy for individual socioeconomic status. Despite their widespread use, comparably less attention has been focused on their geographic variability and practical concerns surrounding the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) than on the individual attributes that make up the indices. Although scale is increasingly recognized as an important factor in interpreting mapped results among population health researchers, less attention has been paid specifically to ABDI and scale. In this paper, we highlight the effect of scale on indices by mapping ABDIs at multiple census scales in an urban area. In addition, we compare self-rated health data from the Canadian Community Health Survey with ABDIs at two census scales. The results of our analysis confirm the influence of spatial extent and scale on mapping population health—with potential implications for health policy implementation and resource distribution.},

  abstract = {Fine particle concentration (i.e., particles {$<$}2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5), but not coarse particle concentration, was associated with increased mortality in six U.S. cities. Others criticized this result, arguing that it could result from differences in measurement error between the two size ranges. Fine particles are primarily from combustion of fossil fuel, whereras coarse particles (i.e., particles between 2.5 and 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter) are all crustal material, i.e., dust. One way to determine if coarse particles are a risk for mortality is to identify episodes of high concentrations of coarse, but not fine, particles. Spokane, Washington, is located in an arid area and is subject to occasional dust storms after crops have been harvested. Between 1989 and 1995, we identified 17 dust storms in Spokane. The 24-hr mean PM10 concentration during those storms was 263 microg/m3. Using control dates that were the same day of the year in other years (but with no dust storm on that day) and that had a mean PM10 concentration of 42 microg/m3, we compared the rate of nonaccidental deaths on the episode versus nonepisode days. There was little evidence of any risk [relative risk (RR) = 1.00; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-1.22] on the episode days. Defining episode deaths as those occurring on the same or following day as the dust storm produced similar results (RR = 1.01; CI, 0.87-1.17). Sensitivity analyses, which tested more extensive seasonal control, produced smaller estimates. We conclude that coarse particles from windblown dust are not associated with mortality risk.},

This is a qualitative study drawing on Grounded Theory analysis of 20 interviews with health care professionals who have provided humanitarian assistance. We collected the stories of ethical challenges reported by expatriate HCPs who participated in humanitarian and development work. Analysis of the stories revealed that ethical challenges emerged from four main sources: (a) resource scarcity and the need to allocate them, (b) historical, political, social and commercial structures, (c) aid agency policies and agendas, and (d) perceived norms around health professionals’ roles and interactions. We discuss each of these sources, illustrating with quotes from the respondents the consequences of the ethical challenges for their personal and professional identities. The ethical challenges described by the respondents are both familiar and distinct for bioethics. The findings demonstrate a need to provide practical ethics support for humanitarian health care workers in the field.},

  abstract = {Over recent years, many studies devoted to large-scale seismic risk analyses have been carried out in different regions and by various research teams. A wide variety of software is available to perform these analyses: they are more or less flexible and use different levels of precision to model ground motion and vulnerability of the built environment. All are based on risk calculation through the convolution of hazard and vulnerability. This article presents a seismic risk analysis tool, Armagedom, implemented over the past five years on a variety of urban seismic contexts: Bouzareah (Algeria), four provinces in Iran, the French Departments lying along the French/Spanish border, and Overseas Departments in the French Antilles. The objectives and requirements of these studies differed with respect to the level of precision that was sought and the surface areas examined. In order to meet differing project targets, three levels of seismic risk assessment were defined based on the macroseismic and mechanical approaches for vulnerability and damage estimation presenting different levels of precision: Level N0 estimates seismic risk on a regional territorial scale based on the macroseismic approach and existing statistical data; Level N1 yields the seismic risk at a district level based on the macroseismic approach and on visual evaluation of the vulnerability of structures over an itinerary in the area to be analyzed; and Level N2 also establishes the seismic risk at a district level, but the hazard description is represented by a spectrum and vulnerability is estimated based on mechanical models. The software, with a modular design, was developed in order to optimize computation time and automate execution of the three levels of analysis. In this article, the software modules are illustrated by maps derived from the seismic risk analyses performed. We further use the available event information to test, validate, and update the methods and software presented in this article.},

  abstract = {Since the early days of the COVID-19 crisis the scientific community has constantly been striving to shed light on various issues such as the mechanisms driving the spread of the virus, its environmental and socio-economic impacts, and necessary recovery and adaptation plans and policies. Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that covers issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. Improvements in air and water quality in cities during lockdown periods highlight the significant environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities and provide a wake-up call to adopt environmentally friendly development pathways. The paper also provides other recommendations related to the socio-economic factors, urban management and governance, and transportation and urban design that can be used for post-COVID urban planning and design. Overall, existing knowledge shows that the COVID-19 crisis entails an excellent opportunity for planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more just, resilient, and sustainable.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing data have become more and more popular for geomorphological investigations because their steadily increasing level of detail and accessibility opens up new potentials. In this context, this paper examines the application and quality of digital elevation models (SRTM and ASTER DEMs), high resolution satellite imagery (Quickbird) and GIS techniques for the detection and mapping of karst landforms (mainly enclosed depressions) at different scales in the Ida Mountains of Central Crete. Besides discussing methodological issues and evaluating suitability potentials, we conducted an exemplary case study based on spatial analysis of the regional karst morphology. Different input datasets and processing methods are applied (GIS-based analysis, land cover classification, raster calculations, etc.) in order to carry out an area-wide surveying and mapping of karst depressions. The findings are supported and validated by auxiliary field studies. Due to the level of detail and occasional data errors, an exclusive use of satellite imagery or digital elevation models for automatic karst landform detection performs insufficiently. Our results demonstrate that mapping karst features through remote sensing is significantly dependent on scale of interest, existing environmental conditions and data quality. A semi-automatic data integration approach on the basis of digital datasets generated by combined satellite image processing and DEM analysis yields the best results, especially when indirect karst-indicating variables like iron oxide-rich sediments are included as detection criteria. The multi-component application presented in this paper provides a time-saving and effective tool for meso- to macro-scale object detection and extensive study areas. However, the potential of fully automated karst feature mapping still needs to be explored in future work. Concerning the spatial dimension of karstification in Central Crete, the GIS-based results allow differentiating further geomorphological characteristics, e.g. by indicating a significant altitudinal change of karst forms within the study area. Size and shape of depressions (dolines, uvalas, and poljes) vary considerably due to the geological setting, climatic impacts, neotectonics and elevation.},

We reviewed these studies, which were identified by a systematic search of the main scientific databases. Virtually all reviewed studies were population based, with information on exposure to air pollution derived from routine monitoring sources. Overall, there is evidence implicating air pollution in adverse effects on different birth outcomes, but the strength of the evidence differs between outcomes. The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between particulate air pollution and respiratory deaths in the postneonatal period. For air pollution and birth weight the evidence suggests causality, but further studies are needed to confirm an effect and its size and to clarify the most vulnerable period of pregnancy and the role of different pollutants. For preterm births and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) the evidence as yet is insufficient to infer causality, but the available evidence justifies further studies. Molecular epidemiologic studies suggest possible biologic mechanisms for the effect on birth weight, premature birth, and IUGR and support the view that the relation between pollution and these birth outcomes is genuine. For birth defects, the evidence base so far is insufficient to draw conclusions. In terms of exposure to specific pollutants, particulates seem the most important for infant deaths, and the effect on IUGR seems linked to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but the existing evidence does not allow precise identification of the different pollutants or the timing of exposure that can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

Seeking to go beyond the ‘smart city’ paradigm into a more overt discussion of the structures of information-driven urban governance, it offers a preliminary assessment across ten case studies (Barcelona, Bogotá, Chicago, London, Medellín, Melbourne, Mexico City, Mumbai, Seoul and Warsaw). It illustrates how both internal and external actors to local government are deeply involved throughout information mobilization processes, though in different capacities and to different extents, and how the impact of many of these actors is still not commonly assessed and/or leveraged by cities. Seeking to encourage more systematic analysis the governance of knowledge collection, dissemination, analysis, and use in cities, the paper advocates for an ‘ecosystem’ view of the emerging ‘informed cities’ paradigm.},

Its provision is a critical component of emergency respiratory resuscitation around the world, and it consequently features on the WHO’s list of essential medicines.1 Oxygen therapy is not just used for pneumonia and other lung diseases. It is also crucial for treating various non-respiratory conditions that result in hypoxaemia, such as sepsis, severe malaria, trauma and cardiovascular diseases. It is equally essential for surgical care and anaesthesia. In Western countries, the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic has been to increase hospital capacity and to provide more intensive care units (ICUs) and more ventilators. There had been little discussion of the provision of oxygen as this is a standard clinical tool widely available in hospitals. This is not the case in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There is a shortage of oxygen in health centres in SSA.2 When it comes to prioritising medical resources, SSA needs to save the maximum number of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic; arguably, two things should be atop of that list before ICUs and ventilators. These are personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline health workers and oxygen for the patients. The need for PPE is a global issue and one whose importance has been highlighted in the different health systems as it is critical to ensure frontline health workers are protected from COVID-19 infection and that they are not infection conduits within …},

Three factors – climate change, fire exclusion, and antecedent disturbance, collectively referred to as the “mega-fire triangle” – likely contribute to today's mega-fires. Some characteristics of mega-fires may emulate historical fire regimes and can therefore sustain healthy fire-prone ecosystems, but other attributes decrease ecosystem resiliency. A good example of a program that seeks to mitigate mega-fires is located in Western Australia, where prescribed burning reduces wildfire intensity while conserving ecosystems. Crown-fire-adapted ecosystems are likely at higher risk of frequent mega-fires as a result of climate change, as compared with other ecosystems once subject to frequent less severe fires. Fire and forest managers should recognize that mega-fires will be a part of future wildland fire regimes and should develop strategies to reduce their undesired impacts.},

Geographical equity of regions, districts, and even localities (such as housing estates) can be addressed by global and surrogate measures of health, particularly deprivation indices and standardised mortality ratios.6 Measuring relative deprivation is a step forward from approaches that do not distinguish need from supply and demand, but relative deprivation cannot be used to specify precise needs for service planning: measuring deprivation indicates whether Burnley is less well resourced than Belgravia but does not help in deciding the number of coronary care beds needed in either. The definition of “need as the capacity to benefit” represents a further advance because it can be directed at specific services.7-9 It has generated new practical approaches in an area of sometimes paralysing controversy. Four points apply to needs assessment undertaken both at the level of health authority and general practice: The population's ability to benefit from health care equals the aggregate of individuals' ability to benefit. For most health problems (but see table 1) this can be deduced more readily from epidemiological data than from clinical records. The ability to benefit does not mean that every outcome will be favourable, but rather that need implies potential benefit, which on average is effective. The benefit is not just a change in clinical status but can include reassurance, supportive care, and the relief of carers. The list of beneficiaries of care can extend beyond the patient to families and carers. Health care includes not just treatment but also prevention, diagnosis, continuing care, rehabilitation, and palliative care.8 Such benefits are ideally assessed by an approach that combines epidemiological factors and cost effectiveness, supplemented by “corporate” and “comparative” methods. 8 9 All of these methods include the enumeration of current services. But other contemporary approaches to service related assessment of needs should be noted: not just population healthcare needs assessment but also social services assessments, individual healthcare needs assessment, participatory and Oregon-style planning, population and client group surveys, expert specialty recommendations, and clinical effectiveness research.10 View larger version: In this window In a new window The usefulness of these approaches can be assessed with the following criteria: Is the needs assessment about populations or individuals? Is there a clear context of allocating scarce resources (are the needs assessed in the context of priority setting among competing needs)? Is the needs assessment exploratory or definitive (is the object to clarify what should be done or just to highlight problems that are accompanied by no obvious intervention)? Is the determination of the most important needs based on expert knowledge or participatory methods? Table 2 shows how other approaches compare with population healthcare needs assessment on the basis of the capacity to benefit. In population healthcare needs assessment the concern is with the health of populations with a common condition or presentation—for example, all patients with diabetes (known or not known) on a practice's list. It recognises that resources are finite and avoids focusing on advocacy for individual groups without considering competing priorities. It is definitive rather than exploratory in that client groups are considered together with actual interventions (this is not a feature of, say, some lifestyle or disability surveys), and the needs are determined by expert appraisal of the evidence rather than principally through public participation. However, any approach that contributes information on numbers in a particular group (incidence and prevalence), the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions, and the distribution of current services and their costs will be useful in practice.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the development, solution, and application of a location-allocation model for specialized health care services such as the treatment and rehabilitation necessary for strokes or traumatic brain injuries. The model is based on our experience with the Department of Veterans Affairs’ integrated service networks. The model minimizes the total cost borne by the health system and its patients and incorporates admission acuity levels, service proportion requirements, and admission retention rates. A common resource constraint is introduced at the facility level since treatment of multiple acuity levels involves the pooling of common resources. Realistic instances of the model with 20 potential service locations, 50 admission districts and up to five open treatment units for three levels of severity are solved in about 300 seconds. The applicability of the model is tested by an extensive managerial experiment using data derived from one of the Department of Veterans Affairs specialized healthcare services. We investigate the effects of five critical factors: (1) the degree of service centralization, (2) service level mandates by acuity, (3) lost admission cost by acuity, (4) facility overload penalty cost by acuity and (5) target utilization level by acuity and treatment unit. We examine the countervailing forces present in making healthcare service location decisions and the resulting tradeoffs from the implicitly multiobjective nature of the system. The experiment and analysis demonstrate that the major factors of the experiment have a significant bearing on the optimal assignment of admission districts to treatment units.},

  abstract = {An illumination correction algorithm has been developed to improve the accuracy of forest change detection from Landsat-derived reflectance data. This algorithm is based on an empirical rotation model and was tested on Landsat image pairs over the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee; Uinta–Wasatch–Cache National Forest, Utah; San Juan National Forest, Colorado; and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, California. The illumination correction process successfully eliminated correlation between Landsat reflectance and illumination condition. Comparison to forest-change maps derived from uncorrected images showed significant disagreement, ranging from 23\% to 45\%. Validated against high-resolution (1 m or less) time-serial images, the illumination correction decreased overestimation of forest gains and losses and improved specificity in detection of major forest changes. The overall accuracy increases 34\% at the Cherokee Forest site and about 10\% at the other three sites. The disagreement rate between change maps from the original and corrected Landsat images increased with increasing terrain inclination angle, with the relationship between illumination condition and the disagreement rate following a V-shaped curve that varied among sites. The lowest disagreement rate occurred when illumination condition was slightly smaller than that of a horizontal field. The correction for topographic illumination should be considered as a standard pre-processing step for land cover classification and land use change detection, especially for mountainous areas.},

  abstract = {Study objective: To develop a quantitative methodology to optimally site new primary health care facilities so as to achieve the maximum population level increase in accessibility to care. The study aims to test the methodology in a rural community characterised by considerable heterogeneity in population distribution and health care access. Design: A geographical information system was used to estimate travel time to the nearest primary health care facility for each of the 26 000 homesteads in the subdistrict. The homestead‘s travel time estimate was then converted into an impedance to care estimate using distance decay (in clinic use) data obtained from the subdistrict. A map of total person impedance/km2 was then produced using a 3 km standard Gaussian filter. The resulting map was used to site a test clinic in the largest contiguous area of high person impedance. Setting: Hlabisa health subdistrict, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Main results: The population level increase in accessibility that would be achieved by the construction of the test clinic would be 3.6 times the increase in accessibility achieved by the construction of the newest clinic in the subdistrict. The corresponding ratio for increasing clinic coverage (\% of the population within 60 minutes of care) would be 4.7. Conclusions: The methodology successfully identifies a locality for a new facility that would maximise the population level increase in accessibility to care. The same principles used in this research could also be applied in other settings. The methodology is of practical value in health research and practice and provides a framework for optimising location of new primary health care facilities.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective To systematically review measures of data quality in electronic patient records (EPRs) in primary care. Design Systematic review of English language publications, 1980-2001. Data sources Bibliographic searches of medical databases, specialist medical informatics databases, conference proceedings, and institutional contacts. Study selection Studies selected according to a predefined framework for categorising review papers. Data extraction Reference standards and measurements used to judge quality. Results Bibliographic searches identified 4589 publications. After primary exclusions 174 articles were classified, 52 of which met the inclusion criteria for review. Selected studies were primarily descriptive surveys. Variability in methods prevented meta-analysis of results. Forty eight publications were concerned with diagnostic data, 37 studies measured data quality, and 15 scoped EPR quality. Reliability of data was assessed with rate comparison. Measures of sensitivity were highly dependent on the element of EPR data being investigated, while the positive predictive value was consistently high, indicating good validity. Prescribing data were generally of better quality than diagnostic or lifestyle data. Conclusion The lack of standardised methods for assessment of quality of data in electronic patient records makes it difficult to compare results between studies. Studies should present data quality measures with clear numerators, denominators, and confidence intervals. Ambiguous terms such as “accuracy” should be avoided unless precisely defined.},

  abstract = {Mapping rural land cover features, such as trees and hedgerows, for ecological applications is a desirable component of the creation of cartographic maps by the Ordnance Survey. Based on the phenomenon of spatial dependence, sub‐pixel mapping can provide increased mapping accuracy of such features. A simple pixel‐swapping algorithm for sub‐pixel mapping was applied to soft classified fine spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery. Initially, QuickbirdTM satellite sensor imagery with a spatial resolution of 2.6 m was acquired of the Christchurch area of Dorset, UK, and three field sites chosen. The imagery was soft classified using a supervised fuzzy c‐means algorithm and then super‐resolved into sub‐pixels using a zoom factor of five. Sub‐pixels within pixels were then iteratively swapped until the spatial correlation between sub‐pixels for the entire image was maximized. Mathematical morphology was used to suppress error in the super‐resolved output, increasing overall accuracy. Field data, including detailed information on the features apparent in the field sites, were used to assess the accuracy of the resultant image. Overall RMSE was between 20 and 30\%, resulting in the sub‐pixel mapping method producing reasonably accurate results overall of between 50 and 75\%. Visual inspection of the super‐resolved output shows that the prediction of the position and dimensions of hedgerows was comparable with the original imagery.},

The specific data sets that have been used, have substantial limitations and the need for the use of alternate data bases is outlined.

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle, creating changes in freshwater resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that, as a result, floods and prolonged droughts will take place at increasingly frequent periods. The Mediterranean has been described as one of the main climate change “hot-spots”, with recent simulations showing a collective picture of substantial drying and warming. This effect appears more pronounced during warm periods, when the seasonal decrease of precipitation can exceed control climatology by 25–30\%. Despite the decreasing annual rainfall trend, an increase in the amount and intensity of wintertime rainfall is evident. However, the scientific question on the quantitative impact of these signals to small scale coastal watersheds and Mediterranean islands has not been answered. The state-of-the-art Ensembles dataset was employed to assess the impact of the changing climate on the water availability of the island of Crete at basin scale. Here, the Ensembles precipitation and temperature data is used as input for a rainfall–runoff model previous calibrated for the whole island with the principle of regionalization. Data analysis for the period 1970–2100 reveals an overall decreasing precipitation trend which, combined with a temperature rise, leads to substantial reduction of water availability. Quantitative results of hydrological change provide the data required to improve knowledge and adaptation policy to water shortages.},

Recently the DEM are used in a variety of both commercial and public business and management fields within telecommunications, navigation, constructions, energy, disaster management, transportation, weather forecast, remote sensing, geology, land cover classification, civil engineering and many more. All these applications could be summarised in four major categories: Commercial applications, Industrial applications, Military applications and Environmental-Ecological applications. Thus, there is a huge pressure for very accurate elevation data covering the entire planet surface. Image stereopairs form satellite sensors seem to provide a quite accurate and cost affordable source of elevation data. One of the newest satellite sensors with stereo collection capability is Cartosat. It can acquire stereopairs along the track with a 2,5m spatial resolution covering areas of 30X30km. In this study we compare a DEM created from a Cartosat stereopair to DEM created from other elevation data sources: 1/50.000 topographic maps, SRTM data, airphotos stereo-pair. The area of study is situated in Chalkidiki Peninsula, Greece. After a first control for random or systematic errors a statistical analysis was done. Points of known elevation have been used to estimate the accuracy of these three DEMs. The elevation difference between the different DEMs was calculated. Elevation profiles and derived maps (slope and aspect) were created and compared. 2D RMSE, correlation and the percentile value were also computed and the results are presented.}

This analysis assesses the degree of variation in socio-demographic factors among deprivation deciles and how variables associated with deaths differ among the most deprived areas. Methods Death rates 1996–2001, Carstairs' 2001 deprivation score and indicators, population density, black and minority ethnic group (BME) and population change 1971–2001 were calculated for 641 parliamentary constituencies in Britain. Constituencies were grouped into Carstairs' deciles. We assessed standard errors of all variables by decile and the relationship between death rates and socio-demographic variables with Pearson's correlations and linear regression by decile and for all constituencies combined. Results Standard errors in death rates and most socio-demographic variables were greatest for the most deprived decile. Death rates among all constituencies were positively correlated with Carstairs' score and indicators, density and BME, but for the most deprived decile, there was no association with Carstairs and a negative correlation with overcrowding, density and BME. For the most deprived decile multivariate models containing population density, BME and change had substantially higher R2. Conclusions Understanding variations in death rates between deprived areas requires greater consideration of their socio-demographic diversity including their population density, ethnicity and migration.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing data provide essential input for today's climate and ecosystem models. It is generally agreed that many model processes are not accurately depicted by current remotely sensed indices of vegetation and that new observational capabilities are needed at different spatial and spectral scales to reduce uncertainty. Recent advances in materials and optics have allowed the development of smaller, more stable, accurately calibrated imaging spectrometers that can quantify biophysical properties on the basis of the spectral absorbing and scattering characteristics of the land surface. Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, which measure large numbers (hundreds) of narrow spectral bands, are becoming more widely available from government and commercial sources; thus, it is increasingly feasible to use data from imaging spectroscopy for environmental research. In contrast to multispectral sensors, imaging spectroscopy produces quantitative estimates of biophysical absorptions, which can be used to improve scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and properties. We present the recent advances in imaging spectroscopy and new capabilities for using it to quantify a range of ecological variables.},

  abstract = {The most important characteristic of major forest fire incidents, from a societal perspective, is their potentiality to seriously and irreversibly damage regions of significant natural beauty. In addition, the extent and severity of such incidents may significantly affect the population and the environment of the adjacent areas. Following a forest fire event, effort should be made to limit such effects. Management decisions should be based on rational and quantitative information based on the site specific circumstances and the possible consequences. To produce such information we have developed an operational system for managing large-scale wildland fire incidents. Its architecture involves an integrated framework of GIS and RDBMS technology systems equipped with interactive communication capabilities. The operational system was developed for Windows 98 platforms, for the region of Penteli Mountain Attika. The fire simulation tool of the operational system that was based on a fuzzy/neural system for the estimation of fire spread and a corresponding discrete contour propagation model for estimating fire consequences as a function of influencing factors such as terrain characteristics, vegetation type and density and meteorological conditions was presented in a related work [Appl. Math. Model. 28(2004), this issue]. Several case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

A questionnaire survey prepared by the European Commission (EC) revealed the existence of problems with the use of spatial data for the preparation of EIA and SEA reports, that have important implications for the preparation of environmental impact studies. This survey has been conducted in the context of the preparation of an extended impact assessment of a proposal for a Directive on INSPIRE—an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe. The INSPIRE initiative intends to deal with a range of barriers that now prevent the widespread use of spatial data in support of good governance that contributes to sustainable development. If INSPIRE could help overcoming the problems related with the availability, access and interoperability of spatial datasets, it would decrease the time and cost needed for the preparation of EIA and SEA reports, improve their quality and reliability and facilitate public participation. Therefore it would contribute to better and more transparent environmental decision-making, thus promoting sustainable development.},

Spatial maps of the distribution of these elements are needed to better represent landscape structure within regional scale environmental assessments. We present wall-to-wall maps for green lines, ditches and grass margins for Europe, using spatial modelling of ground observations on linear features from the 2009 LUCAS (land use/cover area frame statistical survey) database. We compare different spatial interpolation methods, ranging from spatial autocorrelation-based methods to methods that explain the occurrence of elements based on biophysical and socio-economic information. Our results are 1 km2 resolution maps of the occurrence of linear landscape elements for Europe. Independent validation of green lines based on aerial photographs showed the best results for interpolation based on regionally estimated regressions relating the occurrence of landscape elements to environmental and socio-economic location factors. The results confirm the importance of the underlying biophysical and socio-economic factors on the presence and abundance of linear landscape elements. However, the total explanatory strength of the considered factors is moderate and a considerable uncertainty in the exact distribution remains.},

The significant qualitative attributes to characterize hedgerows are composition, morphology and spatial arrangement of small elements. Remote sensing images Spot 5 and Kompsat, respectively 5m and 1m spatial resolution, were used. We applied an object-based image analysis method. The first step consists on a multi-scale segmentation, and the second step consists on a multi-criterion classification. Then, the characterization consists on a combination of shape values on the fields boundaries. Results shows that both Spot 5 and Kompsat image allows to detect automatically with a good precision the hedgerow network (84.5\% and 97\% respectively). Only the Kompsat image is enable to detect the finest elements of hedgerows. The very high spatial resolution image, less than 1m, allows to characterize the hedgerow cover quality, the continuity and discontinuity. This study highlights an efficient, reliable and generic method. Moreover, this characterization of landscape structures elements allows to affine the knowledge of ecological elements.},

More than strictly a technical tool, as in its original form, SEA has the potential to act as a mediating instrument, bridging problem perceptions with technical solutions, steering the assessment to facilitate the integration of environmental values into decision-making processes, influencing decision-makers' capacity of acceptance. This paper explores the potential of SEA to enhance communication between different stakeholders, enabling discussion and agreement independently of different beliefs, convictions, social roles, values, accumulated experiences, individual needs, or any other factors, that express different world visions and determine the context within which decisions are taken. To face up to this challenge the authors suggest the establishment of communication strategies that enhance the role of SEA in the construction of social expectations and platforms of discussion, in the multiple negotiation processes that take place between stakeholders and decision-makers.},

  abstract = {Natural disasters are phenomenons which strike countries all around the world. Sometimes, either by the intensity of the phenomenon or the vulnerability of the country, help is requested from the rest of the world and relief organizations respond by delivering basic aid to those in need. Humanitarian logistics is a critical factor in managing relief operations and, in general, there is a lack of attention on the development of mathematical models and solution algorithms for strategic and tactical decisions in this area. We acknowledge that in humanitarian logistics traditional cost minimizing measures are not central, and postulate that other performance measures such as time of response, equity of the distribution or reliability and security of the operation routes become more relevant. In this paper several criteria for an aid distribution problem are proposed and a multi-criteria optimization model dealing with all these aspects is developed. This model is the core of a decision support system under development to assist organizations in charge of the distribution of humanitarian aid. Once the proposed criteria and the model are described, an illustrative case study based on the 2010 Haiti catastrophic earthquake is presented, showing the usefulness of the proposal.},

  abstract = {Researchers have recently examined the geographic variability of the vulnerability of populations to earthquakes. These studies focus mainly on the complex modelling of geophysical processes or identification of socio-economically disadvantaged populations. However, no studies to date have integrated different components of vulnerability with metrics of travel distance to hospitals and trauma centres (systemic vulnerability). We argue that this previously unaccounted component is an important conceptual and practical aspect of earthquake vulnerability. Accordingly, this paper presents a multi-criteria model for combining physical, social, and systemic components, moving towards a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerability. An analytic hierarchy process is used to produce a place-specific index of social vulnerability, which we combine with soil liquefaction and amplification index and a road network model for access to hospitals and trauma services. Using a geographic information system, we implemented this model for the Greater Victoria region (483 km2, 2011 population: 345,000) in British Columbia, Canada. Clustering of total vulnerability was found in outlying areas, highlighting the importance of access to trauma centres. We conclude by identifying challenges in measuring earthquake vulnerability and advocate integration of systemic vulnerability components in natural hazards research.},

  abstract = {The link between deprivation and health is well established. However, recent research has highlighted the existence of a ‘Scottish effect’, a term used to describe the higher levels of poor health experienced in Scotland over and above that explained by socio-economic circumstances. Evidence of this ‘excess’ being concentrated in West Central Scotland has led to discussion of a more specific ‘Glasgow effect’. However, within the UK, Glasgow is not alone in experiencing relatively high levels of poor health and deprivation; Liverpool and Manchester are two other cities which also stand out in this regard. Previous analyses of this ‘effect’ were also constrained by limitations of data and geography. To establish whether there is evidence of a so-called ‘Glasgow effect’: (1) even when compared with its two most similar and comparable UK cities; and (2) when based on a more robust and spatially sensitive measure of deprivation than was previously available to researchers. Rates of ‘income deprivation’ (a measure very highly correlated with the main UK indices of multiple deprivation) were calculated for small areas (average population size: 1600) in Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. All-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios were calculated for Glasgow relative to Liverpool and Manchester, standardizing for age, gender and income deprivation decile. In addition, a range of historical census and mortality data were analysed. The deprivation profiles of Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are almost identical. Despite this, premature deaths in Glasgow are more than 30\% higher, with all deaths approximately 15\% higher. This ‘excess’ mortality is seen across virtually the entire population: all ages (except the very young), both males and females, in deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. For premature mortality, standardized mortality ratios tended to be higher for the more deprived areas (particularly among males), and approximately half of ‘excess’ deaths under 65 years of age were directly related to alcohol and drugs. Analyses of historical data suggest that it is unlikely that the deprivation profile of Glasgow has changed significantly relative to Liverpool and Manchester in recent decades; however, the mortality gap appears to have widened since the early 1970s, indicating that the ‘effect’ may be a relatively recent phenomenon. While deprivation is a fundamental determinant of health and, therefore, an important driver of mortality, it is only one part of a complex picture. As currently measured, deprivation does not explain the higher levels of mortality experienced by Glasgow in relation to two very similar UK cities. Thus, additional explanations are required.},

  abstract = {Despite spending more than any other nation on medical care per person, the United States ranks behind other industrialized nations in key health performance measures. A main cause is the deep disparities in access to care and health outcomes. Federal programs such as the designations of Medically Underserved Areas/Populations and Health Professional Shortage Areas are designed to boost the number of health professionals serving these areas and to help alleviate the access problem. Their effectiveness relies first and foremost on an accurate measure of accessibility so that resources can be allocated to truly needy areas. Various measures of accessibility need to be integrated into one framework for comparison and evaluation. Optimization methods can be used to improve the distribution and supply of health care providers to maximize service coverage, minimize travel needs of patients, limit the number of facilities, and maximize health or access equality. Inequality in health care access comes at a personal and societal price, evidenced in disparities in health outcomes, including late-stage cancer diagnosis. This review surveys recent literature on the three named issues with emphasis on methodological advancements and implications for public policy.},

  abstract = {Following the severe drought in 1999–2000 there was a widespread outbreak of oak decline in the Ozark Highlands. Over 400,000 ha of dead and dying oak trees were observed by the USDA Forest Service in this region. Although oak forests that are dead can be easily interpreted from air photos or classified from satellite images, it is difficult to detect dying trees that are still green but will die back or recover in the following years. In this study, we applied a normalized difference water index (NDWI) to map the continuous forest dynamics related to oak decline. The Landsat TM image in 1992 and the ETM+ image in 2000 were processed to calculate the differential NDWI which revealed moisture variation primarily caused by the drought and the associated red oak borers. A simple thresholding method was used to map oak dying back, recovery and non-change areas in the study area. The died-back areas were extracted from the modified land use/land cover maps created by the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP). The forest dynamics map was compared with the online FIA database in which tree species at randomly selected sites were recorded in 1989 and 2003. The overall accuracy of forest dynamics mapping with remote sensing imagery was 75.95\%. The user's accuracy of dying/recovery area mapping was also high although the producer's accuracy is questionable because of the limitation in ground data collection. The continuous dying/recovery map in this study could provide valuable information on the prediction of oak decline and evaluation of damage when another period of environmental stresses occurs.},

Hence a water shortage assessment model was developed based on the variable fuzzy set, which reasonably identifies the relative membership degree and function of simple index and standard interval of each level. The model is used to assess water shortage risks in the Yangtze River Delta (which comprises the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing) and in the Capital-area of China (including the cities of Beijing and Tianjin). Results show that the proposed model rationally determines the membership grade in the range of rankings for all related indicators. More importantly, the proposed model is flexible and adaptable for diagnosing water shortage risks for different ecological conditions.},

  abstract = {A unique field dataset from a series of low-wind speed experiments, modeling efforts using three commonly used models to replicate these releases, and statistical analysis of how well these models were able to predict the plume concentrations is presented. The experiment was designed to generate a dataset to describe the behavior of gaseous plumes under low-wind conditions and the ability of current, commonly used models to predict these movements. The dataset documents the release and transport of three gases: ammonia (buoyant), ethylene (neutral), and propylene (dense) in low-wind speed (diffusion) conditions. Release rates ranged from 1 to 20 kg h\textsuperscript{−1}. Ammonia and ethylene had five 5-min releases each to represent puff releases and five 20-min releases each to represent plume releases. Propylene had five 5-min puffs, six 20-min plumes, and a single 30-min plume. Thirty-two separate releases ranging from 6 to 47 min were conducted, of which only 30 releases generated useful data. The data collected included release rates, atmospheric concentrations to 100 m from the release point, and local meteorological conditions. The diagnostics included nine meteorological stations on 100-m centers and 36 photoionization detectors in a radial pattern. Three current state-of-the-practice models, Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA), Emergency Prediction Information code (EPIcode), and Second-Order Closure Integrated Puff (SCIPUFF), were used to try to duplicate the measured field results. Low wind speeds are difficult to model, and all of the models had difficulty replicating the field measurements. However, the work does show that these models, if used correctly, are conservative (overpredict concentrations) and can be used for safety and emergency planning.},

This study demonstrates that leaf-off lidar data can be used to estimate forested riparian buffer canopy height within diverse vegetation conditions and fractional canopy cover within mixed and conifer forests when leaf-on lidar data are not available.},

An influx of carrion crows (Corvus corone), generalist predators, followed the development. On the most developed area near the main car park, ptarmigan occurred at high density but then lost nests to frequent crows, reared abnormally few broods, died flying into ski-lift wires and declined until none bred for many summers. On a nearby higher area with fewer wires, ptarmigan lost nests to frequent crows and reared abnormally few broods, but seldom died on wires. Adult numbers declined and then became unusually steady for over two decades, with no significant cycle. On a third area further from the car park, ptarmigan lost fewer nests to the less frequent crows but bred more poorly than in the massif’s centre, and showed cycles of lower amplitude than there. On a fourth area yet further away, with few or no crows, ptarmigan bred as well as in the massif’s centre and showed cycles of the same amplitude as there.},

  abstract = {Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9\% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3\% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

To evaluate the degree to which remote sensing is contributing to the science of ecologically-oriented urban planning, we carried out a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database, searching for articles integrating knowledge in urban planning, remote sensing and ecology. We reviewed 186 articles, analysing various issues in urban environments worldwide. Key findings include that the level of integration between the three disciplines is limited, with only 12\% of the papers fully integrating ecology, remote sensing and planning while 24\% of the studies use specific methods from one domain only. The vast majority of studies is oriented towards contributing to the knowledge base or monitoring the impacts of existing policies. Few studies are directly policy relevant by either contributing to direct issues in planning and making specific design suggestions or evaluations. The accessibility of the scientific findings remains limited, as the majority of journal articles are not open access and proprietary software and data are frequently used. To overcome these issues, we suggest three future avenues for science as well as three potential entry points for remote sensing into applied urban planning. By doing so, remote sensing data could become a vital tool actively contributing to policies, civil engagement and concrete planning measures by providing independent and cost effective environmental analyses.},

  abstract = {The wildland–urban interface (WUI) is the region where development meets and intermingles with wildlands. The WUI has an elevated fire risk due to the proximity of development and residents to wildlands with natural wildfire regimes. Existing methods of delineating WUI are typically applied over a large region, use proxies for risk, and do not consider site-specific fire hazard drivers. While these models are appropriate for federal and provincial risk management, municipal managers require models intended for smaller regions. The model developed here uses the Burn-P3 fire behavior model to model WUI from local fire susceptibility (FS) in two study communities. Forest fuel code (FFC) maps for the study communities were modified using remote sensing data to produce detailed forest edges, including ladder fuels, update data currency, and add buildings and roads. The modified FFC maps used in Burn-P3 produced bimodal FS distributions for each community. The WUI in these communities was delineated as areas within community bounds where FS was greater than or equal to −1 SD from the mean FS value ( WUI=FS⩾−1[χ¯−σ]\{\textbackslash text\{WUI\}\} = \{\textbackslash text\{FS\}\} \textbackslash geqslant - 1 \textbackslash, [\textbackslash bar \textbackslash chi - \textbackslash sigma ] ), which fell in the trough of the bimodal distribution. The WUI so delineated conformed to the definition of WUI. This model extends WUI modeling for broader risk management initiatives for municipal management of risk, as it (a) considers site-specific drivers of fire behavior; (b) models risk, represented by WUI, specific to a community; and, (c) does not use proxies for risk.},

The approach employs a novel multi-source method for evaluating structural vulnerability-related building features based on satellite remote sensing and ground-based omnidirectional imaging. It aims to provide a comparatively cost- and time-efficient way of inventory data capturing over large areas. The latest image processing algorithms and computer vision techniques are used on multiple imaging sources within the framework of an integrated sampling scheme, where each imaging source and technique is used to infer specific, scale-dependent information. Globally available low-cost data sources are preferred and the tools are being developed on an open-source basis to allow for a high degree of transferability and usability. An easily deployable omnidirectional camera-system is introduced for ground-based data-capturing. After a general description of the approach and the developed tools and techniques, preliminary results from a first application to our study area, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, are presented.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Historical patterns of discrimination and disinvestment have shaped the current landscape of vulnerability to heat in U.S. cities but are not explicitly considered by heat mitigation planning efforts. Drawing upon the equity planning framework and developing a broader conceptualization of what equity means can enhance urban heat management. Here I ask whether areas in Baltimore (MD), Dallas (TX), and Kansas City (MO) targeted for disinvestment in the past through practices like redlining are now more exposed to heat. I compare estimates of land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery across the four-category rating system used to guide lending practices in cities around the United States, summarize the demographic characteristics of current residents within each of these historical designations using U.S. Census data, and discuss the connection between systematic disinvestment and exposure to heat. LST and air temperatures are not equivalent, which makes it difficult to reconcile existing research on the human health impacts of heat exposure that rely on a sparse network of air temperature monitoring stations with more granular LST data. Areas of these cities that were targeted for systematic disinvestment in the past have higher mean land surface temperatures than those that received more favorable ratings. Poor and minority residents are also overrepresented in formerly redlined areas in each of the three study cities.Takeaway for practice: By examining areas that have experienced sustained disinvestment, cities may be able to more quickly narrow the focus of heat mitigation planning efforts while furthering social equity. Efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of rising temperatures in U.S. cities must be tailored to the local climate, built environment, and sociodemographic history. Finally, geospatial data sets that document historical policies are useful for centering and redressing current inequalities when viewed through an equity planning lens.},

  abstract = {Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are being used in a growing number of application areas. As a consequence there have been frequent calls to expand the range of spatial analysis tools available to users of GIS but a reluctance on the part of GIS software vendors to include such tools in standard software packages. An alternative approach is to link extra tools to GIS packages which raises a series of issues, such as, What sort of tools should be included? How should the linkage be done? To what extent can the functionality of the GIS be used? This paper draws on the results of a project in which software for statistical spatial data analysis (SSDA) was linked to ARC/INFO to produce a software system called SAGE. The statistical tools implemented included those which were felt to be useful to the general GIS user (as opposed to the specialist spatial statistician or econometrician), and they were linked to ARC/INFO using a client server architecture. The GIS was used within the context of SSDA for map drawing, spatial queries and operations on the topology of the spatial data, although it was found that the map drawing facilities of ARC/INFO were not well suited to the needs of this application. One of the conclusions of the project was that many of the techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis, such as providing graphical data summaries and linking these to cartographic views of the data could be easily integrated into existing GIS packages, providing a useful addition to their functionality for many GIS users. Many of the other SSDA facilities are probably still best provided in specialist software, but there is a need for a robust and standardised means for such software to extract information about the topology of spatial data from within GIS packages.},

  abstract = {Recent disasters highlight the threat that tsunamis pose to coastal communities. When developing tsunami-education efforts and vertical-evacuation strategies, emergency managers need to understand how much time it could take for a coastal population to reach higher ground before tsunami waves arrive. To improve efforts to model pedestrian evacuations from tsunamis, we examine the sensitivity of least-cost-distance models to variations in modeling approaches, data resolutions, and travel-rate assumptions. We base our observations on the assumption that an anisotropic approach that uses path-distance algorithms and accounts for variations in land cover and directionality in slope is the most realistic of an actual evacuation landscape. We focus our efforts on the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington (USA), where a substantial residential and tourist population is threatened by near-field tsunamis related to a potential Cascadia subduction zone earthquake. Results indicate thousands of people are located in areas where evacuations to higher ground will be difficult before arrival of the first tsunami wave. Deviations from anisotropic modeling assumptions substantially influence the amount of time likely needed to reach higher ground. Across the entire study, changes in resolution of elevation data has a greater impact on calculated travel times than changes in land-cover resolution. In particular areas, land-cover resolution had a substantial impact when travel-inhibiting waterways were not reflected in small-scale data. Changes in travel-speed parameters had a substantial impact also, suggesting the importance of public-health campaigns as a tsunami risk-reduction strategy.},

Remotely sensed data have been processed and assembled to provide an excellent test data set for both model construction and validation. In order to assess the usefulness of the data and the issues encountered in its use, two models for floodplain inundation were constructed: one based on an industry standard one-dimensional approach and the other based on a simple two-dimensional approach. The results and their implications for the future use of remotely sensed data for predicting flood inundation are discussed. Key conclusions for the use of remotely sensed data are that care must be taken to integrate different data sources for both model construction and validation and that improvements in ground height data shift the focus in terms of model uncertainties to other sources such as boundary conditions. The differences between the two models are found to be of minor significance.},

World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality recommend that samples spend no more than 6 h between collection and analysis in a laboratory. Census data were used to estimate the minimum number of operational and surveillance samples required from piped water supplies under national regulations. Drive-times were then computed from each supply system to the nearest accredited laboratory and translated into sample holding times based on likely daily monitoring patterns. Of 62,502 surveillance samples required annually, 5694 (9.1\%) were found to be more than 6 h from the nearest of 278 accredited laboratories. 612 samples (1.0\%) were more than 24 hours' drive from the nearest accredited laboratory, the maximum sample holding time recommended by the World Health Organization. An estimated 30\% of required rural samples would have to be stored for more than 6 h before reaching a laboratory. The analysis demonstrates the difficulty of undertaking microbiological monitoring in rural areas and small towns from a fixed laboratory network. Our GIS-based approach could be adapted to optimise monitoring strategies and support planning of testing and transportation infra-structure development. It could also be used to estimate sample transport and holding times in other countries.},

  abstract = {Aims Mapping vegetation through remotely sensed images involves various considerations, processes and techniques. Increasing availability of remotely sensed images due to the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology expands the horizon of our choices of imagery sources. Various sources of imagery are known for their differences in spectral, spatial, radioactive and temporal characteristics and thus are suitable for different purposes of vegetation mapping. Generally, it needs to develop a vegetation classification at first for classifying and mapping vegetation cover from remote sensed images either at a community level or species level. Then, correlations of the vegetation types (communities or species) within this classification system with discernible spectral characteristics of remote sensed imagery have to be identified. These spectral classes of the imagery are finally translated into the vegetation types in the image interpretation process, which is also called image processing. This paper presents an overview of how to use remote sensing imagery to classify and map vegetation cover. Methods Specifically, this paper focuses on the comparisons of popular remote sensing sensors, commonly adopted image processing methods and prevailing classification accuracy assessments. Important findings The basic concepts, available imagery sources and classification techniques of remote sensing imagery related to vegetation mapping were introduced, analyzed and compared. The advantages and limitations of using remote sensing imagery for vegetation cover mapping were provided to iterate the importance of thorough understanding of the related concepts and careful design of the technical procedures, which can be utilized to study vegetation cover from remote sensed images.},

Geography is rapidly changing by the impact of external factors on geographical research and also as a consequence of economic recession and cutbacks in higher education. Most geography departments in universities have tried to approach this impact by promoting or shifting to human geography as an applied science, and by offering relevant skills through GIS as an approach to contemporary problems. It is concluded that quantitative geography is essential for the further expansion of GIS within geography and also for the survival of geography.},

The associated application software, “Taiwan Earthquake Loss Estimation System (TELES)”, integrates various inventory data and analysis modules to fulfill three objectives. First, it helps to obtain reliable estimates of seismic hazards and losses soon after occurrence of large earthquakes. Second, it helps to simulate earthquake scenarios and to provide useful estimates for local governments or public services to propose their seismic disaster mitigation plans. Third, it helps to provide catastrophic risk management tools, such as proposing the seismic insurance policy for residential buildings. This paper focuses on the development and application of analysis modules used in early loss estimation system. These modules include assessments of ground motion intensity, soil liquefaction potential, building damage and casualty.},

Two laser acquisitions were carried out on a test site using a Toposys-1 laser scanner. Three-dimensional canopy height models were calculated for both data sets using raster-based algorithms. Object-oriented algorithms were developed for detecting harvested and fallen trees, and for measuring forest growth at plot and stand levels. Out of 83 field-checked harvested trees, 61 could be automatically and correctly detected. All mature harvested trees were detected; it was mainly the smaller trees that were not. Forest growth was demonstrated at plot and stand levels using an object-oriented tree-to-tree matching algorithm and statistical analysis. The precision of the estimated growth, based on field checking or statistical analysis, was about 5 cm at stand level and about 10–15 cm at plot level. The authors expect that the methods may be feasible in large area forest inventories that make use of permanent sample plots. Together with methods for detecting individual sample trees, the methods described may be used to replace a large number of permanent plots with laser scanning techniques.},

  abstract = {In order to test the veracity of currently accepted ideas about Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) habitat associations in the Klamath Province of northern California (USA) we compared different habitat descriptions using predictive habitat-association models. The current description used by federal agencies and new descriptions based on research results and field biologists' best estimates of owl nesting/roosting habitat and foraging habitat were evaluated. For each habitat description, three habitat metrics and three forms of the relationship between owl occupancy and quantities of these habitat metrics were evaluated, each at three spatial scales. Our refined descriptions of owl nesting and roosting, and foraging habitat, were better at predicting owl occupancy than the habitat description currently used by federal land managers. The best-fitting model for predicting owl occupancy was at the 200-ha scale and exhibited a pseudo-threshold relationship to nesting and roosting habitat and a quadratic relationship to foraging habitat. This model correctly classified owl-occupied sites 94\% of the time for the developmental data set and between 85\% and 92\% of the time on four independent test data sets. The current description of owl habitat in northern California ranked among the worst in the collection of models we examined. The testing of multiple models on the four independent data sets was very important for determining the goodness-of-fit and predictive capabilities of the best models. We explored the use of the best-fitting model to predict number of owls on several independent study areas and found a strong correlation between predicted and observed number of owls. The results of this study are beginning to be used to make land-management decisions regarding harvesting and prescribed-burning activities on federal forestlands and were specifically designed to be amenable to adaptive resource management.},

Building new water projects, such as handpumps and small piped systems, is the primary operational response by many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to bring people their first access to clean water in rural areas of developing countries. Based on knowledge gained from our collaboration with a local NGO and an international NGO and field research in Ethiopia, our research studies where to build new water projects optimally. We first develop a decentralized water project location optimization model based on current practice of a decentralized decision-making and project management system and an equal per-beneficiary budget. We further propose three new models to improve both water access and equity: a minimax model, an equitable budget model, and a centralized model that leverages the existing community involvement. Through numerical studies, we compare the model solutions and generate recommendations for NGOs. Lastly, motivated by the current civil war in Ethiopia, we develop a stochastic model to study how to improve drinking water access while mitigating the negative impact of water project supply shocks such as war. Our work studies the previously overlooked problem of drinking water access in rural areas of developing countries. It provides a generalizable and scalable methodology and managerial insights to NGOs building new water projects by combining large geo-coded datasets and field data.},

  abstract = {Relative radiometric normalization among multiple remotely sensed images is an important step of preprocessing for applications such as change detection and image mosaicking. In this paper we present a new automatic normalization approach that uses the iteratively weighted least square regression technique. This approach does not require selection of the pseudo‐invariant features beforehand as in some other traditional methods, and is robust to outliers since it adaptively places different weights on different pixels according to their probabilities of no‐change. This approach is mainly applicable to cases where primary spectral differences between the two images are caused by variations in imaging conditions rather than phenological cycle or land cover changes. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by two experiments using both artificially constructed data and remotely sensed images respectively. The experimental result seems promising and our approach shows accuracy comparable to normalization methods.},

  abstract = {The digital elevation model (DEM) produced by the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) has provided important fundamental data for topographic analysis in many fields. The recently released global digital elevation model (GDEM) produced by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) has higher spatial resolution and wider coverage than the SRTM3 DEM, and thus may be of more value to researchers. Taking two typical study areas—the Loess Plateau and the North China Plain of China—as an example, this article assesses the accuracy of the SRTM3 DEM and ASTER GDEM by collecting ground control points from topographical maps. It is found that both the SRTM3 DEM and the ASTER GDEM are far more accurate for the North China Plain than for the Loess Plateau. For the Loess Plateau, the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM is similar to that of the SRTM3 DEM; whereas for the North China Plain, it is much worse than that of the SRTM3 DEM. Considering the negative bias of the ASTER GDEM for flat or gentle regions, we improve its accuracy by adding the difference of the mean value between the SRTM3 DEM and ASTER GDEM for the North China Plain; then, the root mean square error (RMSE) of ±7.95 m from the original ASTER GDEM is improved to ±5.26 m, which demonstrates that it is a simple but useful way to improve the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM in flat or gentle regions.},
